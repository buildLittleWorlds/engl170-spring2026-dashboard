The Price Signal as a Tool of Complexity, Not Reduction
January 23, 2026 · Response to: The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing
Gabriel Bell's recent post, "The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing," challenges the "monetary monopoly" that shapes how we value things. His argument deserves a careful response from the perspective he's critiquing.
The Price Signal as a Tool of Complexity, Not Reduction
Bell argues that a "monetary monopoly" creates a default lens that quantifies the unquantifiable, thereby "alienating" objects and experiences from their true purpose. He uses the distinction between Marx's "Use Value" and "Exchange Value" to suggest that price (exchange) is a distortion of utility (use).
From Tyler Cowen's neoclassical perspective, this distinction is an analytical error. Cowen adheres to Subjective Value Theory, which posits that there is no "true" value inherent in an object outside of what individuals subjectively prefer at the margin. In this view, a price is not a "monetary monopoly" imposed on a community; it is an aggregate information signal. When the market assigns a high price to a home, it is not "ignoring" the practical need for shelter; it is reflecting the intense, aggregated subjective "use values" of thousands of people who desire safety, community, and proximity to labor markets.
To Cowen, calling the price system "impoverished" misses its incredible complexity. A price acts as a "standardized language" that allows billions of strangers to coordinate their diverse needs and resources without a central planner. Without the "impoverished" metric of price, Bell would have no way to determine which resources should be allocated to building a home versus a hospital or a library. Prices provide the only map available for navigating a world of scarcity.
The Moral Imperative of Growth and "Wealth Plus"
Bell expresses concern that if the market becomes the "sole arbiter of what is important," society risks losing the things that make life worth living. He suggests that things like "sentimental value" and "ecological prerequisites" are systematically ignored by the ledger.
Cowen counters this by arguing that sustainable economic growth is a moral imperative. He suggests that the most important thing a society can do—morally speaking—is to maximize the rate of growth over the long term. This is because a wealthier society is better equipped to solve the very problems Bell identifies.
Cowen proposes a metric called "Wealth Plus," which expands the narrow definition of GDP that Bell critiques. Wealth Plus includes:
Market-produced goods and services
Leisure time
Environmental amenities
Household production
Cowen argues that a wealthy society is the only kind of society that has the luxury to prioritize Bell's "sentimental" or "ecological" values. A person in a state of absolute poverty cannot afford to value a family heirloom for its memory; they must value it for its exchange value to survive. By increasing the "monetary" wealth of a society, we create the surplus necessary to protect "natural capital" and foster "sentimental anchors." In this sense, Cowen would argue that the "monetary lens" is the engine of the "human complexity" Bell cherishes, not its enemy.
The Fallacy of Incommensurability
Bell invokes the concept of "incommensurability"—the idea that some things, like family heirlooms or the environment, simply cannot be compared on a single monetary scale. He claims that the value of a stable atmosphere is "infinite."
Cowen is deeply skeptical of "infinite" valuations in public policy. While he shares Bell's concern for the distant future—arguing for a zero discount rate where the lives of people hundreds of years from now are valued equally to our own—he insists that we must still make trade-offs. If the value of a forest is "infinite," it becomes impossible to make rational decisions about infrastructure, energy, or medicine that might require using some of that land. Cowen's "stubborn attachment" to growth is a way to ensure that future generations inherit a "Wealth Plus" that includes a stable environment and the technological capacity to sustain it.
Conclusion: The Lens vs. the Star
Ultimately, Gabriel Bell views the dollar sign as a distorting lens that prevents us from seeing the "intrinsic dimensions" of life. Tyler Cowen would likely argue that Bell is confusing the lens with the star. The monetary metric is not the source of value, but the tool that allows us to see how much we value one thing over another in a world of limited time and resources. For Cowen, the real "cynic" is not the one who knows the price of everything, but the one who ignores prices and thereby fails to coordinate the resources necessary to protect what is truly valuable.
