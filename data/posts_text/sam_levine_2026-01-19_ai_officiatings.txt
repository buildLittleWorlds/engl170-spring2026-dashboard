Kevion Milton’s post “The Digital Whistle: How AI is Changing Basketball Officiating” raises a powerful question: does perfect officiating remove the “soul” from basketball? He argues that human referees provide discretion, psychological tension, and drama, and that AI could sterilize the game. While I agree that the human element has shaped the sport’s identity, I disagree with the idea that officiating mistakes are part of what makes basketball meaningful. In my view, accuracy and fairness are not the enemies of the game; they are its foundation.
It’s easy to romanticize human error because it feels like a reminder that sports are still human. But we have to ask: is the game’s meaning really tied to human limitations, or to the competitive structure and rules that define it? The “soul” of basketball comes from the skill, strategy, and intensity of the players, not from the inconsistencies of the officiating. If a referee misses a crucial call, it doesn’t create a memorable moment—it creates an unfair one. The drama that follows a missed call is often just a reaction to injustice, not a celebration of the sport.
Human Error Isn’t “Soul” — It’s a Limitation
Human referees make mistakes because they are human. Kevion is right that the game is fast and physical, and that officials often use discretion to keep the game flowing. But when a defender pushes an offensive player out of bounds or commits a clear foul and no whistle is blown, the game is not becoming more “soulful.” It is becoming unfair. Basketball’s rules exist to protect players and ensure fair competition. Missing calls in critical moments is not a romantic feature of the sport; it is a flaw in enforcement.
Another issue is that human error is inconsistent. A foul that is called in the first quarter might be ignored in the last quarter. A referee’s mood, crowd noise, and fatigue can influence their decisions, and those factors have nothing to do with the actual game. If the goal is to determine which team is better, these inconsistencies create a distorted outcome. This is why professional leagues have invested in replay systems and review technology: not because they want to remove the human element, but because they want to reduce the chance that a mistake decides a championship.
“An algorithm does not care about your star status, and it does not feel the pressure of a screaming home crowd.”
— Kevion Milton, The Digital Whistle
Kevion’s point about the psychological aspect of officiating is real, but I believe it’s more a description of bias than of beauty. The ability to “work the refs” is not necessarily a skill that makes basketball better—it is a way of exploiting inconsistency. If players can win games by manipulating a referee’s tendencies, then the game is already being decided by factors outside athletic skill. In that sense, the psychology of officiating is less about competitive depth and more about systemic imbalance.
This is especially important when we consider how teams already use data analytics to study referees. If AI becomes the primary decision-maker, that reduces the advantage of teams with better scouting departments and levels the playing field. Instead of the “ref bias” becoming part of the strategy, teams would have to focus on skills and execution. In a league where championships are decided by fractions of a percent, reducing human inconsistency could actually increase competitive fairness.
Accuracy Improves Fairness — Not Entertainment
In response to the “soul” argument, it’s important to recognize that the goal of officiating is fairness, not drama. A study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences shows that referees miss calls at higher rates in high-pressure situations, especially in late-game moments. Those errors directly affect outcomes and create unfair advantages. If the sport’s purpose is to determine the best team, then missing calls is not a feature—it is a problem.
“The elimination of bias and mistakes that could impact game results is greatly assisted by standardized officiating, which ensures that referees make decisions consistently and impartially.”
— Fang Kai Xin & Hj Hamdan Bin Mohd Ali, systematic review on officiating and fairness
This external research supports the idea that improving accuracy is not about removing “soul,” but about protecting fairness. A standardized officiating system—especially one supported by AI—reduces bias and inconsistency. That is not a threat to basketball’s identity; it is an improvement in its integrity.
The same logic applies to other sports, like rugby. In rugby, referees sometimes call penalties without realizing players have released in a ruck, or they miss offside lines during fast play. These mistakes can disrupt the flow and create unfair advantages. AI could help the game run smoother by catching these errors instantly. That would not take away the sport’s “soul”; it would enhance the game by ensuring it is played according to the rules as they are defined.
Centaur Officiating: The Best of Both Worlds
Where I fully agree with Kevion is his proposed middle ground: “Centaur Officiating,” where AI handles objective calls and humans handle subjective ones. This hybrid system respects both fairness and humanity. AI is excellent at determining line calls, shot-clock violations, and out-of-bounds decisions because it is fast and precise. Humans are better at interpreting intent, managing emotions, and keeping the game moving.
This balance aligns with Dr. Plate’s ideas about AI and intellectual work. In his writing, Dr. Plate emphasizes that AI does not eliminate human thinking; it changes where the thinking occurs. Similarly, AI in officiating does not replace referees; it changes how they spend their cognitive energy. Instead of being overwhelmed by objective data, officials can focus on the subjective aspects that require empathy and judgment.
Why “Perfect Accuracy” Isn’t a Threat
The key question is not whether AI removes drama, but whether it preserves fairness. When a foul is missed, the game outcome is affected by a mistake—not by athletic skill or strategy. In that moment, the game is not “beautifully flawed.” It is simply flawed. Basketball is meant to be a contest decided by players, not by human limitations. AI can help keep the game true to its purpose.
In conclusion, while human officiating has shaped basketball’s culture, it should not be treated as the standard of fairness. AI-supported officiating can reduce bias and improve accuracy, and a centaur model ensures the human element remains in the subjective parts of the game. The “soul” of basketball is not in missed calls—it is in competition, athletic skill, and fair play. If AI can help the game become more consistent and just, then accuracy should be seen as an enhancement, not a threat.
