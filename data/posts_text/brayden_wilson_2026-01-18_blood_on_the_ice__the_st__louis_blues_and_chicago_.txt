Blood on the Ice: The Brutal, Beautiful Rivalry of the St. Louis Blues and Chicago Blackhawks
January 18, 2026
In the world of professional hockey, there are rivalries born of geography, and then there are rivalries born from pure, unadulterated hatred. The relationship between the St. Louis Blues and the Chicago Blackhawks is very mutual: they hate each other. Separated by just 300 miles of I-55, these two cities have spent over half a century trading goals, punches, and postseason heartbreaks.
Whether it's the "Original Six" arrogance of the Blackhawks or the "Expansion Grit" of the Blues, every time these two teams meet, the atmosphere shifts from a standard hockey game to a civic battle for Midwest power. Ironically, the rivalry began with a helping hand. In 1966, the owners of the Chicago Blackhawks actually lobbied for St. Louis to receive an expansion franchise. Their motivation wasn't neighborly love; they owned the dilapidated St. Louis Arena and wanted to unload the building onto a new tenant.
The NHL awarded the franchise without a formal bid, and in 1967, the Blues were born. But the "friendship" ended the moment the puck dropped. By 1970, the two teams were placed in the same division, and the proximity of the cities—combined with the already established Cardinals-Cubs baseball feud—ensured that the fans would despise each other from day one.
The rivalry reached its absolute boiling point in the late 1980s and early 90s. This was the era of the "Chuck Norris Division," a time when games were often decided by fisticuffs but also finesse. No single event defines the hatred better than March 17, 1991. A game at the old Chicago Stadium devolved into total chaos, now known as the "St. Patrick's Day Massacre". A hit by Chicago’s Jeremy Roenick on Blues defenseman Harold Snepsts ignited a fuse that featured 278 total penalty minutes and 12 player ejections.
"You get indoctrinated into that rivalry right away. The hatred for the Blues and Blackhawks among the two cities is quite spirited." — Chris Pronger
As both teams navigate different stages of rebuilding and contention in 2026, the fire remains. On January 7, 2026, the Blackhawks reminded the Blues that they still have teeth, dismantling St. Louis 7-3 at the United Center. While the Blues won the previous meeting in December, this recent blowout showcased the emergence of Chicago's new youth movement, led by Oliver Moore.

The two teams will meet one final time this season on April 11, 2026. With the Blues fighting for a wildcard spot and the Blackhawks looking to play spoiler, expect the sticks to be high and the tempers to be short. In the Battle of I-55, some things never change.
