The Silicon Mirage: Why AI Abundance May Be Our Newest Form of Scarcity
January 25, 2026
In his recent post, "The Silicon Equalizer," Dominic Debro paints a compelling, almost hypnotic portrait of a future where artificial intelligence acts as the ultimate democratic force[cite: 2]. In Dominic’s view, AI is the great leveller—a tool that collapses the cost of intelligence, decentralizes expertise, and ushers in a post-scarcity era[cite: 3]. It is a vision rooted in techno-optimism, suggesting that as the marginal cost of production drops toward zero, we will all find ourselves wealthier and freer[cite: 4].
However, I believe it overlooks a fundamental law of our current economic and social reality: the Consumption Paradox[cite: 6]. My argument is that AI will not usher in an era of abundance, but is far more likely to engineer a new era of scarcity[cite: 7, 8]. This scarcity will not be born from a lack of "stuff," but from a lack of access[cite: 9]. By replacing the human worker, AI systematically dismantles the mechanism—wages—that allows families to provide for themselves[cite: 10].
The Fallacy of the Equalizer
Wealth in the age of AI is not determined by who can use the tool, but by who owns the infrastructure[cite: 16]. The "intelligence" Dominic speaks of is hosted on massive server farms owned by a handful of trillion-dollar corporations[cite: 17]. Unlike the industrial revolution, where a worker could eventually own their own tools, the computational power and proprietary datasets of AI are inherently centralized[cite: 18]. A study from the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy highlights a "Productivity Paradox," noting that the wealth generated tends to cluster around "superstar" firms[cite: 19, 70].
The Labor Displacement Crisis
According to a 2024 report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), nearly 40 percent of global jobs are exposed to AI, with that number rising to 60 percent in advanced economies[cite: 24, 68]. While some white-collar workers may adapt, the Brookings Institution found that millions of others lack the "adaptive capacity" to manage such a transition[cite: 26, 27, 69]. When we talk about exposure rates, we are talking about parents unable to pay for healthcare or food because their tasks have been automated away[cite: 29].
The Consumption Paradox
Capitalism relies on a feedback loop: businesses pay workers, and workers use those wages to buy products[cite: 34]. If you remove the worker, you break the loop[cite: 35]. Researchers in a paper published in the MPRA argue that the abundance of machine intelligence actually devalues human cognitive labor[cite: 40, 71]. When human time—the only thing most people have to sell—becomes "abundant" because no one wants to buy it, it becomes worthless[cite: 41].
Conclusion
True abundance is not measured by how much a computer can do; it is measured by how well a human can live[cite: 63, 64]. If we want AI to be an "equalizer," we must recognize that without radical structural changes, it will be nothing more than a marketing slogan for a new era of inequality[cite: 59, 60].
