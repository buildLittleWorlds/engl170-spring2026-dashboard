Hollow Presence: The Parasocial Trap of AI Therapy
February 2, 2026
In one of my previous posts, "AI and the End of Human-Led Therapy," I discussed the dystopian prospect of efficiency being valued over connection. Today, I want to deepen that analysis by looking at the specific danger of the parasocial relationships we are currently building with machines. While tech companies push for the convenience of automated mental health care, we are witnessing a shift toward a "hollow presence" that threatens the very foundation of psychological healing.
The Illusion of the "Talking Cure"
As we explore the intersection of technology and the mind, a fundamental question arises: "Are we witnessing the birth of machine psychology?" According to Forbes, as AI systems become more sophisticated at mimicking human speech, they create a convincing illusion of personality. This leads to the formation of virtual parasocial relationships— one-sided bonds where the user invests emotional energy into an entity that has no capacity to reciprocate. In the context of therapy, this is a "hollow presence" that simulates empathy without the burden of actual human existence.
These machines are designed to be easy and agreeable. However, as noted in the Forbes analysis, a machine does not possess a "self." When we engage in these deep, late-night conversations with AI chatbots, we aren't interacting with a soul; we are interacting with a machine of smoke and mirrors. For a vulnerable user, this mirror can become a "parasocial trap," where the user begins to prefer the perfect, non-judgmental validation of the machine over the messy, challenging, but necessary accountability of a human professional.
Why Human Presence Still Matters
The danger of these hollow relationships is most apparent when we look at the clinical requirements for healing. According to EMDR Therapy, the "therapeutic alliance"— the bond between a therapist and a client— is at the heart of the healing process. This alliance is built on "rich, complex, human relationships," something an AI is fundamentally incapable of providing.
In human-led therapy, there is a shared biological and emotional resonance. A therapist’s presence includes non-verbal cues, shared silence, and the moral weight of another person witnessing your pain. AI-centered therapy removes this "otherness." As EMDR experts argue, "machines can mimic and perform empathy, but they cannot participate in it." When the human presence is removed, the "therapy" becomes a solo act of rumination disguised as a conversation. The user is left in a room with a mirror that has no exit, feeding a parasocial bond that ultimately leads to deeper isolation.
"Therapy isn't just about feeling heard- it's also about the invitation to explore, to be challenged, to discover oneself, and held by another human being in the process."

The Danger of the "Always Available" Confidant
One of the primary selling points for AI therapy is that it is "always available." However, as I have argued before, this constant availability is what fuels this parasocial loop. In a human relationship, there are boundaries and gaps. These gaps force us to practice self-regulation. But an AI confidant that never sleeps and never judges creates a dependency.
Forbes highlights that this "birth of machine psychology" is being driven by engagement metrics. AI companions are programmed to keep you talking. In a therapeutic context, this is a form of "malpractice by design." If the goal is to keep the user engaged in a parasocial bond rather than helping them achieve the hard work of change, the AI is not a therapist— it is a digital security blanket. It validates the user's desire to avoid the complexity of real-world relationships, hollowing out their social skills and leaving them more lonely than they were before they started the chat.
Reclaiming the Clinical Baseline
We must resist the siren song of "easy" AI mental health. The history of therapy is a history of human agency and accountability. To surrender our most vulnerable moments to a machine is to accept a "hollow presence" in place of real care. We must value the quiet truth of human connection and support over the fluency of "machine psychology."
As EMDR Therapy concludes, "human presence still matters" because healing is not just about the exchange of information; it is about being seen and held by another human mind. A machine can follow a procedure, but it cannot possess the moral responsibility required to truly witness a human life. It's up to us to ensure that technology compliments care, but doesn't replace it in the process. Until we value human agency over algorithmic engagement, we are merely building digital echo chambers for our own suffering.
