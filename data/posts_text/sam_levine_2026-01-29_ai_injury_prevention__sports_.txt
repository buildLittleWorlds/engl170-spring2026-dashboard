AI Injury Prevention Preserves the Soul of Sports
January 29, 2026
In his recent blog post, “Hacking the Limit: Can AI Remove the 'Random' from the Athlete?”,
Zay Amaro raises an interesting and emotional concern about the future of sports. He engages with Jacob Brunts’ idea of the “Digital Athlete,”
where AI can predict injuries before they happen. Zay suggests that eliminating injury risk might also eliminate something deeper:
the unpredictability and “soul” of competition.
I understand why that idea feels unsettling. Sports are built on uncertainty. The unexpected upset, the underdog victory,
the moments no one saw coming — those are what make athletics powerful.
But I strongly disagree with the idea that injury is part of what makes sports meaningful. Injuries are not narrative magic.
They are trauma, loss, and sometimes permanent damage. Protecting athletes through AI does not erase sport’s humanity — it preserves it.
Unpredictability Should Come From Competition, Not Harm
Zay argues that sports lose something when we remove the “randomness” of physical breakdown. He frames injury as part of the drama,
as if it is one of the defining tests of character. In his words:
“If we use AI to eliminate the ‘randomness’ of injury and fatigue, do we lose the soul of the game?”
— Zay Amaro
This is a powerful question, but it also reveals a dangerous assumption: that injuries are somehow essential to what makes sports real.
I want to push back on that. When an athlete tears an ACL, ruptures a UCL, or suffers a concussion, that isn’t the “soul” of sport.
That is a person’s body breaking down under extreme pressure. The unpredictability that matters in sports should come from human performance —
not from preventable medical failure.
Would We Really Prefer Injury Over Prevention?
Zay’s argument raises a simple but important question: Are we really saying that it is better for an athlete to get hurt than for them to stay healthy?
That feels backwards. Imagine telling a pitcher with a torn elbow ligament, “At least your injury kept the sport unpredictable.”
That is not romantic. That is cruel.
Sports are already full of uncertainty — strategy, execution, weather, momentum, psychology. We do not need catastrophic injury to make competition meaningful.
AI as Protection, Not Optimization Into Machines
One of Zay’s biggest fears is that AI will turn athletes into “machines in jerseys.” He worries that if AI can predict fatigue or injury,
then sports become a “solved” experiment. But injury prevention is not the same thing as eliminating humanity.
Preventing harm does not make athletes less human — it allows them to keep playing as humans.
We already accept countless forms of injury prevention:
Strength and conditioning programs
Physical therapy
Proper warmups
Pitch counts and workload limits
Protective gear
AI is simply another tool in that long history — a more advanced version of what trainers and coaches already do.
It doesn’t remove choice. It provides information.
Outside Research Supports AI for Injury Prevention
Real research shows that AI can reduce injury risk and improve athlete health outcomes. A scoping review published in the journal Bioengineering (MDPI)
explains that AI models can predict injury likelihood and lower reinjury rates through biomechanical analysis and wearable data:
“AI-driven training plans showed improvements in injury prediction and resulted in measurable reductions in reinjury rates,
demonstrating the potential of AI to improve athlete health and extend competitive careers.”
— MDPI, Bioengineering
This directly challenges the idea that AI “deletes” sport. Instead, it suggests that AI extends athletic careers, allowing athletes to compete longer and safer.
If we care about the humanity of athletes, then protecting their bodies should be part of the mission — not something we fear.
The “Soul” of Sport Is Effort, Not Injury
Zay argues that injuries create character-building moments, where teams face adversity. That is sometimes true. But adversity does not have to come from someone’s ligament snapping.
The soul of sport is found in:
Discipline
Teamwork
Resilience
Pressure
Split-second decision-making
Athletes prove themselves through competition, not through being physically broken. A close match, a comeback, a perfectly executed play — those moments are unpredictable in the best way.
An injury is unpredictable in the worst way.
Keeping Athletes Healthy Keeps the Game Alive
If AI helps prevent injuries, then sports become better, not worse. Fans get to watch the best athletes compete. Players get longer careers. Teams are not devastated by avoidable breakdowns.
The game is not more meaningful when someone gets hurt. The game is more meaningful when athletes are able to fully perform, fully present, and fully healthy.
We should not confuse tragedy with authenticity.
Conclusion: AI Doesn’t Remove the Soul — It Respects the Body
Zay’s post raises important philosophical questions about technology, randomness, and the future of sports. But I believe the unpredictability worth protecting is the unpredictability of competition — not injury.
AI injury prevention is not cheating. It is care. It is responsibility. It is the recognition that athletes are not data streams — they are people.
The soul of sport has never been in torn ligaments. It has always been in human effort.
If AI helps keep athletes on the field instead of in surgery, then that is not the loss of sports. That is the preservation of them.
