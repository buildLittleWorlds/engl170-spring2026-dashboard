The Sovereign Writer vs. The Institutional Student
January 25, 2026 · Response to: The Agency Paradox by Dr. Plate
Your analysis of Dr. Lively's presentation at the TMCC AI Summit highlights a critical flaw in current academic "resistance" movements. If we claim to value agency, we cannot selectively withdraw it when the student's choice of tool makes us uncomfortable.
1. The Fallacy of the "Controlled Struggle"
Lively's argument rests on the idea that "struggle" is the only forge for thinking. While composition scholarship (and common sense) agrees that deep thought often requires friction, Lively suggests that this friction must be artificially preserved by banning tools.
This creates a "walled garden" version of agency. It's the difference between a sailor learning to navigate by the stars because they choose to master the craft, and a sailor being forced to use a sextant because the captain threw the GPS overboard. One is an act of identity-building; the other is an act of enforced obsolescence.
2. "Ethical Opacity" and the Right to Process
Your reference to The Case Against Disclosure is particularly timely. By regulating the process rather than the product, institutions like the ones Lively advocates for are essentially attempting to surveil the "architecture of the mind."
In any other professional field, we judge the result:
Does the legal brief cite real cases?
Is the biological report accurate?
Is the prose rhetorically effective?
When we shift the goalpost from "Is this good work?" to "How exactly did you produce this?", we move from being educators to being forensic investigators. As you noted, this surveillance of the creative act fundamentally undermines the "professional identity" Lively claims to protect. A professional is someone who takes responsibility for their output, regardless of their workflow.
3. The Shift in "Rhetorical Choice"
Perhaps the most significant oversight in the "Analog Teaching" movement is the failure to recognize that prompting and AI-collaboration are themselves rhetorical acts. Deciding how to guide an AI, identifying when its tone is too "hallucinatory" or "flat," and revising its output to better fit a specific audience are high-level rhetorical choices. By banning these tools, we aren't just protecting "old" skills; we are actively preventing students from developing the meta-rhetorical skills they will need to maintain their agency in a world where these machines are ubiquitous.
A Question for the Author
You argue that "the first student [who uses AI as a thinking partner] has developed a skill that transfers to a world where AI exists."
If we accept your principle of "Ethical Opacity," how do we address the "black box" of learning? If a student submits a perfect paper but cannot explain their own argument during a subsequent class discussion, does the institution have a right to intervene in their process, or should the "failure" simply be reflected in the evaluation of their knowledge (e.g., through oral exams or in-class performance)?
This is a vital contribution to the discourse. You've clearly identified that you cannot "give" agency by mandate; it must be exercised by choice.
