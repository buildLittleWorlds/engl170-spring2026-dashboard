The Sorcerer’s Tool: Disney and the Agency Paradox
Published on January 18, 2026 | Category: Technology & Education
In the recently discussed essay, The Agency Paradox, the author explores a thorny contradiction in modern education: the push to "protect" student agency by banning AI tools. The argument is that by removing the choice to use AI, educators are actually stripping students of the very agency they claim to defend. True agency, the post argues, isn't the absence of tools; it is the informed, difficult choice of how and when to use them.
This tension between the "magic" of automation and the "agency" of the creator is a story Disney has been telling—both on-screen and behind the scenes—for nearly a century.
Mickey and the Perils of Outsourcing
The most literal representation of the Agency Paradox exists in the 1940 masterpiece Fantasia, specifically during "The Sorcerer’s Apprentice." Mickey Mouse finds himself in the exact position of a student facing a daunting writing assignment (in his case, hauling endless buckets of water).
Mickey doesn’t want to develop the "professional identity" of a water-carrier; he wants the result without the struggle. He "outsources" his agency to a magical tool, the enchanted broom. At first, it looks like a triumph of efficiency. But as the author of The Agency Paradox notes, outsourcing the process often means losing control of the outcome. Mickey didn't learn the "rhetorical choices" of magic; he simply triggered a process he couldn't stop.
Key Insight: The lesson of Fantasia isn't that magic is evil; it’s that the Sorcerer has agency because he has put in the "struggle" to understand the tool.
Mickey, by bypassing the struggle, becomes a victim of his own automation. This mirrors the concern that students who use AI as a "shortcut" rather than a "partner" lose their seat at the steering wheel of their own education.
The "Nine Old Men" and the Digital Shift
Beyond the screen, Disney’s own history is a masterclass in navigating the Agency Paradox. In the 1980s and 90s, the animation industry faced its own "AI moment": the transition from hand-drawn (analog) animation to Computer Generated Imagery (CGI).
Many traditional animators felt that computers would "take away the agency" of the artist. They argued that if the computer calculated the "in-betweens" (the frames between major poses), the artist was no longer "thinking" through the movement. It was the same argument Dr. Rob Lively makes against AI in the blog post: if you don't struggle with the line, you aren't an artist.
However, Disney’s "renaissance" creators, and later the team at Pixar, proved the Agency Paradox wrong. They didn’t ban the computer to protect the artist’s agency; they used the computer to expand it. By automating the tedious "low-level" tasks of ink-and-paint and perspective, animators were able to make higher-level "rhetorical choices" about acting, lighting, and emotional beats. They didn't stop thinking; they started thinking at a different scale.
The Imagineering Approach: Trusting the Creator
The blog post argues for "ethical opacity," the idea that creators should be judged on their final product, not the specific tools they used to get there. This is essentially the "Imagineering" code.
When Disney Imagineers build a land like Pandora or Galaxy’s Edge, they use a massive array of automated tools: algorithmic rock-work design, 3D printing, and robotic animatronics. If Disney HQ had banned these tools to "protect the agency" of the sculptors, the results would be far less immersive. Instead, Imagineering operates on the principle that the human intent is what matters.
Conclusion: Becoming the Sorcerer
The author of The Agency Paradox concludes that the way to develop professional judgment is to give students the opportunity to exercise it, including the judgment of when to use AI.
"I don't make movies to make money, I make money to make more movies." — Walt Disney
If we follow the Disney model, the solution to the AI dilemma isn't to ban the "magic brooms" from the classroom. It is to teach students to be the Sorcerer. Agency isn't found in the struggle of the bucket; it’s found in the wisdom of the spell. We shouldn't be teaching students how to avoid the magic; we should be teaching them how to master it.
