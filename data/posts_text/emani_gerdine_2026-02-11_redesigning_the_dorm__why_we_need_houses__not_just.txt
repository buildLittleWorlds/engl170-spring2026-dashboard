Redesigning the Dorm: Why We Need Houses, Not Just Beds
February 11, 2026
College is supposed to be our home for four years, but right now, most dorms feel more like a temporary room than a real place to live. I think schools, including Lindenwood, should rethink how they build student housing. We need spaces that feel like houses, not just a bed and a bathroom.
Access to Real Food
People always talk about how college students don't eat enough, but look at what we have access to. Most of us are stuck with a microwave and processed foods that we are getting tired of. We need kitchens. Even if it's not in every individual room, every student lounge area should have a full kitchen. Being able to cook a real meal would change everything for our health and our energy levels.
The Support of Pets
Being far from home and not knowing many people in a new place is hard on your mental health. I love my dog and wish he could be here with me without the stress of him having to be a "certified" support animal. Not every pet is a certified service animal, but they all provide support. If you're struggling with being away from home, having your pet there makes a massive difference, and you shouldn't have to pay extra for that companionship.
The Need for Privacy
Finally, we need to talk about roommates. Everyone is different, and not everyone respects your sleep or your privacy. The suite-mate idea is okay, but sharing a single room is tough. You can't truly be in your own space or have your boyfriend or girlfriend over comfortably when you have a roommate there. We deserve our own privacy and a space where we can actually do what we want.
College is a big transition. Making dorms feel more like actual homes would make that transition so much easier for everyone.
