What’s More Addicting: Social Media or AI?
What’s More Addicting: Social Media or AI?
In class, we spent a lot of time discussing addiction in the digital age, especially when it comes to social media. Most people, including many of my classmates, seemed to agree that social media is the most addicting technology we face today. It makes sense. Social media is designed to keep us scrolling, clicking, and constantly consuming content. The algorithms often seem to know what we want before we do, and doomscrolling has become almost a universal experience. Many of us have talked about how it sometimes feels like “brain rot,” how hours can disappear in a blur of feeds and videos.
So if you asked the average person, “What’s more addicting: social media or AI?” social media seems like the obvious answer.
However, I think the conversation often overlooks an important point: although AI doesn’t trigger the same compulsive behaviors as social media, it is shaping different kinds of dependencies that may be just as powerful.
Why Social Media Addiction Seems Obvious
Social media addiction is easy to recognize because it is emotional, visual, and constant. Platforms are built around engagement — the more time you spend on them, the more profitable you are as a user. That means the apps are structured to make leaving difficult.
In our class discussion, we talked about how social media becomes addictive because it trains users to constantly seek stimulation and distraction. This is an important insight, because it shows that addiction isn’t only about liking something — it’s about developing repeated habits that are reinforced over time. Social media platforms encourage users to keep checking, scrolling, and engaging, making the behavior feel automatic rather than intentional.
One of the most obvious examples is the endless scroll. Unlike a book or a movie, there is no natural stopping point. Content keeps coming indefinitely. That makes it easy to lose track of time — something most of us have experienced. We go on for “just a few minutes” and suddenly realize an hour, two hours, or more has passed.
Social media also works through social reward. Likes, comments, shares, and reactions create feedback loops that keep people coming back. Psychologists often compare these features to gambling mechanics — intermittent, unpredictable rewards that encourage repeated checking and engagement.
From this perspective, it’s hard to argue that social media isn’t extremely addictive. It works on our emotions and impulses in ways many of us can’t easily control.
A Different Kind of Dependence: AI
AI feels different — and because it feels different, people often dismiss it when talking about addiction.
Most people aren’t doomscrolling ChatGPT for hours. There are no flashy videos, no endless feeds to keep your attention. So on the surface, AI doesn’t feel addicting in the same way social media does.
But addiction doesn’t only look like compulsive scrolling. Sometimes it looks like dependency.
AI has become something many people automatically turn to whenever they have a question, problem, or even minor uncertainty. Instead of sitting with confusion, thinking through an issue, or trying to find our own answer, we ask AI immediately.
That creates a new kind of habit: outsourcing thinking.
For example, if I don’t know how to phrase an email, solve a homework problem, or even decide what to cook, the instinct becomes: ask AI. That instinct may not feel compulsive in the same way scrolling TikTok does, but it still shapes behavior. The “itch” isn’t to scroll — it’s to know.
In that way, AI addiction may be less about dopamine hits and more about cognitive reliance. We may not crave AI emotionally the way we crave social media, but we may become dependent on it intellectually.
In our class discussion, some skepticism arose about calling this behavior “addiction,” since it doesn’t involve constant scrolling or emotional reward. However, I think the skepticism actually highlights a key point: addiction can take different forms. In the case of AI, it is less about immediate gratification and more about forming habitual dependence on a tool for thinking and decision-making.
In short, social media makes us scroll; AI makes us stop thinking for ourselves.
Jonathan Haidt and The Anxious Generation
This question also connects to larger cultural critiques about technology and attention. Jonathan Haidt, in The Anxious Generation, argues that the rise of smartphones and social media has fundamentally reshaped childhood and adolescence. In his book, he writes:
“The phone-based life makes it difficult for people to be fully present with others when they are with others, and to sit silently with themselves when they are alone.”
This line highlights a deeper consequence of digital life — that constant connectivity can disrupt attention, presence, and our ability to engage with the world around us rather than through screens. This is directly relevant to the discussion about addiction and habit formation.
Where I agree with Haidt is that modern technologies have reshaped attention and social experience. But where I disagree is in the proposed solution. Some interpretations of his work suggest we should simply ban phones from schools or delay digital exposure. I don’t think removing phones from schools or ignoring technology is the best answer — technology is now deeply woven into social life, safety, communication, and learning.
The deeper issue isn’t the existence of technology — it’s the habits and dependencies we create around it.
An Outside Source: Screen Time & Mental Health
Research on screen time supports concerns about how digital technologies shape behavior and well-being. Studies show that excessive screen time — including social media use — is associated with higher risks of anxiety, depression, and attention difficulties among adolescents. This evidence underscores the idea that how we use digital tools matters, not just whether we use them. The harm doesn’t come from screens themselves, but from patterns of use that reduce physical activity, interrupt sleep, and fragment attention.
AI, even if it doesn’t create emotional addiction, can still shape cognitive habits in ways that matter. If we constantly outsource thinking and problem-solving to AI, our capacity for patience, persistence, and independent reasoning may weaken — even if we don’t feel “addicted” in the classic sense.
Conclusion: Two Different Addictions — Both Real
So what is more addicting: social media or AI?
Social media is the more obvious addiction. It is immediate, emotional, and engineered through endless engagement.
AI is the quieter addiction. It does not pull us through entertainment, but through reliance.
Social media addiction makes us scroll.
AI addiction makes us stop thinking for ourselves.
The real danger may not be choosing which one is worse, but recognizing that both technologies shape human habits in different ways. Social media hijacks attention; AI reshapes cognition.
Instead of only asking, “Which is more addicting?” we should be asking: What kind of people are these tools training us to become?
