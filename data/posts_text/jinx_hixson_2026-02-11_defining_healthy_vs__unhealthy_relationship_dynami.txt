Defining Healthy vs. Unhealthy Relationship Dynamics
February 11, 2026
In my previous post, "Fostering Healthy Relationship Skills," I discussed how a healthy relationship is built through a foundation of consistent effort and specific psychological skills such as active listening and mutual respect. I argued that these skills are a radical act of care and compassion for others in a world full of the "not my problem" mentality. Today, I want to provide a more concrete roadmap for these skills by looking at the specific characteristics of healthy and unhealthy dynamics.
The Anatomy of a Healthy Relationship
According to Mass.gov, a healthy relationship is one where both partners feel supported and connected, but still feel like independent individuals. This is a crucial distinction in our digital era; a healthy relationship does not swallow your agency, but rather enhances it. In a healthy relationship, you should feel comfortable being yourself and feel safe to share your thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment.
The core characteristics of a healthy relationship include:
Respect: Valuing your partner's opinions and boundaries.
Trust: Feeling confident that your partner is honest and has your best interests at heart.
Honesty: Being truthful and open about your feelings and actions.
Equality: Making decisions together and sharing power in the relationship.
Good Communication: Talking openly about problems and listening to each other's perspectives.
These pillars align with the "survival mechanism" of social connectedness we’ve discussed. When you're in a healthy relationship, you're more likely to make healthy choices and have better mental and physical health outcomes because the bond is based on mutual safety.
Identifying the Red Flags: Unhealthy Dynamics
To truly foster healthy relationship skills, we must also be able to identify what an unhealthy relationship looks like. An unhealthy relationship is characterized by a lack of respect and a desire for control. Unlike the 70% of couples who improve through CBCT by focusing on supportive dynamics, those in unhealthy relationships often feel trapped in cycles of pressure and isolation.
Warning signs of an unhealthy relationship include:
Control: One partner makes all the decisions or tells the other what to do, what to wear, or who to spend time with.
Isolation: Keeping a partner away from friends and family.
Pressure: Forcing a partner to do things they are not comfortable with.
Dishonesty: Lying or keeping secrets to maintain power.
Volatility: Unpredictable mood swings or outbursts that make the other person feel like they are "walking on eggshells."
This volatility is the antithesis of the "stable effects" we look for in long-term psychological health. When one partner uses power and control to dominate the other, the "biological necessity of connection" is weaponized, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and physical illness. These behaviors within relationships can also veer into abusive territory if the behavior isn't addressed and corrected.
"You should feel comfortable expressing your needs, wants, fears, hopes, and limits and being truthful about how certain situations or behaviors make you feel."

The Role of Agency and Boundaries
In our discussions on AI and agency, I noted that a machine cannot possess the moral responsibility required to foster five plus years of stability. The same is true in human relationships when agency is removed. An unhealthy relationship often involves a dynamic in which one person's needs are ignored in favor of the other's control. Reclaiming your agency means setting boundaries— deciding what you will and will not tolerate in a relationship.
Mass.gov emphasizes that everyone deserves to be in a relationship that is free from violence and fear. Whether it is physical, emotional, or digital, abusive behavior is never okay. Fostering healthy skills means learning to walk away from dynamics that prioritize a need for control over connection. As I’ve argued before, trust is the physiological buffer that protects us, but trust can only exist where there is safety. You cannot be truly vulnerable with someone who uses your history or your fears as a way to control you.
Choosing a Healthy Path
As we continue to navigate the complexities of human-to-human connection, we must use these blueprints to evaluate our own lives. A healthy relationship assists us in the "hard work of change" by providing us with a stable foundation. By prioritizing mutual respect, individuality, trust, and equality, we ensure that our social connectedness remains a survival mechanism that improves our lives rather than a trap that diminishes them.
We must value the truth of human connection— the kind that is based on respect and shared presence— over the fluency of unhealthy, control-driven dynamics. I'm more convinced than ever that the most effective form of healthcare is engaging in a relationship that allows you to be your full, independent self.
If you or someone you know is in an unhealthy relationship, there is help available. You are not alone. You can reach out to a professional or call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE (7233).
