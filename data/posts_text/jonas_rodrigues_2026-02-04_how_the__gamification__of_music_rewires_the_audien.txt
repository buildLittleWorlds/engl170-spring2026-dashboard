Cognitive Atrophy: How the "Gamification" of Music Rewires the Audience
February 4, 2026
If you care about the future of human creativity, you need to watch Adam Neely’s recent deep dive into generative AI music. In his video, "The dark secret of AI music (Suno, Udio)," Neely offers a blistering critique of platforms that turn songwriting into a text-prompt slot machine. He masterfully dismantles the techno-optimist narratives surrounding these tools, revealing a landscape where art is subordinated to capital and convenience.
Neely identifies the rot at the core of this technology: a deliberate move by Silicon Valley to reframe music not as a communicative art form, but as a disposable consumer experience. While Neely’s analysis is spot-on, his final conclusion offers a glimmer of hope that I believe is dangerously optimistic. He suggests that as recorded music drowns in AI-generated "slop," live performance will become the prestigious refuge of true human connection.
I argue the opposite. The forces driving AI music—gamification, deskilling, and hyper-individualism—are too corrosive to be contained within our headphones. They are coming for the stage, too.
1. The Destructiveness of "Gamification"
Neely highlights a chilling admission from Suno CEO Mikey Schulman: the goal is to make the music industry as big as the gaming industry by turning music into an interactive "consumer experience." This is not a benign evolution; it is destruction through trivialization. Gamification replaces deep engagement with cheap, dopamine-driven feedback loops.
This philosophy is bolstered by the so-called "Techno-Optimist Manifesto," which posits that providing AI-generated culture is an ethical imperative for those suffering from "reality deprivation"—those who cannot afford "high-quality physical reality" (Andreessen). By framing music as a utility for the "reality underprivileged," Silicon Valley justifies the replacement of human agency with algorithmic intervention, a move critics rightly label as "reactionary elitism" (Paris).
When music is gamified, the value shifts from the artifact to the action of generation. The profound human need to communicate complex emotions is reduced to the same psychological mechanic as pulling a lever on a slot machine. The "user" feels a rush of creation, but they have risked nothing and communicated nothing.
2. The Atrophy of Skill and Virtue
Suno has explicitly listed "impatience" as a virtue of its user base. Neely contrasts this with classical virtue ethics, noting that impatience is the enemy of wisdom and courage—traits essential to artistry. The rise of "prompt engineering" is a catastrophic deskilling event.
The technical mechanics of these models encourage this atrophy. As detailed in recent research, modern platforms use a "Diffusion-Transformer Hybrid" approach: Transformers handle the "compositional planning" (verses and choruses), while Diffusion models perform "acoustic rendering" ("Computational Ontologies"). Features like "structural meta-tags" allow users to bypass the struggle of learning music theory or arrangement.
Just as GPS can atrophy our sense of direction, relying on AI to bridge verses and generate melodies atrophies musical intuition. We face a genuine threat of "cognitive atrophy," where the specialized musical intuitions developed over centuries of human history begin to wither ("Music and Artificial Intelligence"). The struggle to master an instrument is not an "inefficiency" to be disrupted; it is the process where art is made. By outsourcing this struggle, we are creating a generation incapable of making music without digital training wheels.
3. The Narcissistic Feedback Loop
Perhaps the loneliest trend is "antisocial listening," where users primarily listen to tracks they just generated. Historically, music has been our communal glue—a shared language of concerts, iconic albums, and radio. AI is fracturing this into millions of hermetically sealed echo chambers.
Streaming platforms have long utilized algorithms that lead to "taste tautology" and "filter bubbles" (Epstein et al.). By reinforcing prior preferences, these systems reduce musical diversity and limit exposure to novel genres. Generative AI accelerates this to its logical extreme. When you are the only audience for your own computer-generated output, music ceases to be a cultural conversation and becomes a narcissistic mirror.
This creates a closed loop where the user is never challenged by the "otherness" of another human's perspective. It is the ultimate atomization of society, where we no longer need shared experiences, only personalized feedback loops that confirm our existing biases.
4. Why Live Music Will Not Save Us
Neely concludes his video by hoping that live performance will become the new gold standard. This is wishful thinking. The "gamification" mindset will eat through the walls of the concert hall as surely as it dissolved the recording studio.
The Economic Reality
Technocapitalists are motivated by wealth extraction and cutting labor costs. We are already seeing the normalization of holographic tours and virtual idols. The "hierarchy of automation risk" suggests that roles focused on "technical execution"—like session musicians or basic arrangers—are highly susceptible to displacement ("The Impact of Generative AI").
How long until venues find it more profitable to license an "AI DJ" that can read the room and generate seamless, copyright-free music in real-time rather than paying a human band? The technology to generate "structurally coherent, multi-minute audio compositions" is already a commercial reality ("Computational Ontologies"). Venues operating on thin margins will inevitably choose the cheaper, more reliable, and infinitely customizable algorithmic option.
The Corruption of the Audience
The most insidious downfall is that gamification retrains the audience. If a generation grows up addicted to the instant gratification of Suno—where they control every parameter and songs are rarely longer than two minutes—they will lose the patience for genuine live performance.
Physiological studies back this up. Biometric data reveals that when listeners encounter AI-generated music, they show higher pupil dilation and increased blink rates. These markers are linked to increased "cognitive load," suggesting that AI-generated music is actually more taxing for the brain to decode (Epstein et al.). While AI can trigger emotional valence, it is consistently rated lower for expressiveness and authenticity. If the audience is conditioned to prefer the "functional" over the "expressive," the demand for human nuance will evaporate. A ninety-minute set by a human band, complete with imperfections and tuning breaks, will feel painfully slow to a brain rewired for instant engagement.
The Infinite Karaoke Nightmare
Even if humans remain on stage, what will they be playing? They will likely be forced to perform the "slop." If AI-generated viral hits dominate the streaming charts, working musicians in cover bands and wedding gigs will have to learn and perform music written by machines. The human becomes a mere puppet executing the algorithm's output, the final step in the deskilling process.
The Legal "Copyright Vacuum"
As a final blow to the industry, the legal landscape is shifting beneath our feet. The U.S. Copyright Office (USCO) has reinforced that protection is reserved only for works "owing their origin to a human agent" ("Computational Ontologies"). This creates a "copyright vacuum" for purely prompt-based generations, effectively placing them in the public domain.
While this seems like a win for "freedom," it actually incentivizes corporations to flood the market with high-volume, cost-free AI music that dilutes the royalty flows for human artists. Why license a human song when you can generate a million royalty-free tracks for free? The systemic displacement of human technical labor is not a bug of the system; it is its primary commercial objective.
Conclusion
Adam Neely is right to sound the alarm. The "gamification" of music is a sociopolitical maneuver designed to bypass labor and extract wealth by debasing an ancient human art form. But we must abandon the comforting illusion that live performance is a safe harbor. If we allow the fundamental way we interact with music to become a cheap, impatient "consumer experience," there will be no sanctuary left. The game is rigged, and if we keep playing by Silicon Valley’s rules, human creativity is going to lose.
