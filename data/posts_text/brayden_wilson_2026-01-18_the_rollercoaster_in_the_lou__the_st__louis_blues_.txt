The Rollercoaster in the Lou: Analyzing the St. Louis Blues’ Recent Surge and Struggles
January 18, 2026
Midway through the 2025-26 NHL season, the St. Louis Blues find themselves in the gritty, unpredictable middle of the season[cite: 2]. As of mid-January 2026, the Blues sit with a record of 19-21-8, placing them 6th in a competitive Central Division[cite: 3].
The Jim Montgomery Era
While stats might suggest a downward trend, the last two weeks have showcased the "Jim Montgomery Era"—a blend of resilient defense and a "next man up" mentality[cite: 4]. After a demoralizing three-game losing streak [cite: 6], the team's character emerged during a critical homestand at the Enterprise Center[cite: 7].
The turning point occurred on January 13, when Joel Hofer delivered a 30-save shutout against the Carolina Hurricanes[cite: 8]. This momentum carried into January 16, where the Blues disrupted the Tampa Bay Lightning's 11-game winning streak with a 3-2 shootout victory clinched by Jordan Kyrou[cite: 11, 12].
Injuries and Emerging Talent
Success is often a game of health, and the Blues are currently struggling. Star center Robert Thomas was placed on Injured Reserve on January 12 with a lower-body injury[cite: 14]. Thomas is the engine of the offense, leading with 33 points[cite: 15]. However, Nick Bjugstad has been a revelation since his return [cite: 17], and 23-year-old Jake Neighbours is on a three-game point streak, leading the team with 12 goals[cite: 19, 20].
"If the Blues are to make a serious push for a Wild Card spot, the coaching staff may have to ride the 'hot hand,' which currently belongs to the 25-year-old Joel Hofer." [cite: 26]
The Road Ahead
The team embarks on a three-game road trip starting tonight, January 18, against the Edmonton Oilers[cite: 27]. Dylan Holloway is cleared to return for this matchup, which should provide a massive boost[cite: 21]. To survive this stretch, the defense—led by Philip Broberg, Justin Faulk, and Colton Parayko—must step up[cite: 28, 29, 30].
