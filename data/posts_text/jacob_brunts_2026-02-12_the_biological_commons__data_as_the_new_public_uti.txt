The Biological Commons: Data as the New Public Utility
February 12, 2026
Response to: The Digital Commons: Infrastructure for Care (Dr. Plate)
Dr. Plate discusses the "Digital Commons" as a necessary infrastructure for modern care. I want to take his "Commons" a step further: we need a Biological Commons.
Privacy as a Bottleneck
The biggest barrier to the Optimization Protocol is the cultural obsession with data privacy. Individual optimization is limited by individual data. However, as noted in Nature Medicine, the rise of "Federated Learning" allows AI to train on large-scale health data without compromising individual identity. This shared data allows AI to calculate protocols rather than guess them.
The Moral Obligation to Contribute
If care is a moral objective that lives outside the person providing it, then contributing to the Biological Commons is a moral act. We are moving from isolated biological islands to nodes in a high-performance network. It’s time to stop hiding behind our privacy and start contributing to our potential.
