Markets, Metrics, and the Myth of Certainty
January 26, 2026
In his post "Trading on Reality with Kalshi," Caleb Murphy explains how prediction markets allow people to trade on the outcome of real-world events. Caleb describes Kalshi as a place where "knowledge is power," and where the collective wisdom of the market creates a price for the future. This is the ultimate expression of the "automated thinking" we've discussed this semester: the idea that if we aggregate enough data and enough opinions, we can solve for the "X" of the future. But as a sports fan, this brings me back to my favorite question: Can we ever truly trade on the unpredictable?
Caleb notes that Kalshi markets are binary—either something happens or it doesn't. This is very similar to sports betting or NFL "win probabilities." When a team has a 90% chance to win with two minutes left, the "market" of observers has reached a consensus. But that 10% "void" is where the most human moments happen. Caleb’s exploration of trading on reality shows us that we are desperate to put a price tag on randomness, to turn the chaos of life into a "fluent" chart that we can understand and profit from.
The Gambler’s Fallacy vs. The Random Reality
One of the dangers of platforms like Kalshi, or advanced NFL analytics, is that they can create a "fluency illusion" of their own. When we see a percentage attached to an event—like a 70% chance of a specific law passing or a 60% chance of a team making the playoffs—we feel like we have "grasped a coherent mechanism," as our instructor put it. We feel like the future is already written, and we are just waiting for the clock to run out. But the market isn't the event itself. The map is not the territory.
In the NFL, the "market" often gets it wrong because it cannot account for the "intentionality" that Gabriel Bell wrote about or the "grit" that Tom Bishop highlighted in boxing. A prediction market might say a team is "dead," but the market doesn't know the character of the locker room. As noted in a Bloomberg feature on prediction markets, while these tools are excellent at aggregating information, they struggle with "Black Swan" events—the completely random, out-of-nowhere moments that change everything. In sports, a Black Swan event is a backup quarterback coming off the bench to lead a 28-3 comeback in the Super Bowl.
Faith in the Unpredictable
As I wrap up my responses for this week, I see a clear theme emerging. From Sam Levine’s "forklifts" to Caleb’s "prediction markets," we are using AI and data to try and simplify a complex world. We want the comfort of the stats. But whether it’s in the boxing ring, on the trading floor, or on the 50-yard line, there is a ceiling that data cannot reach. My faith tells me that this is because we weren't meant to live in a perfectly predicted world. The "cost of human relevancy" is the price we pay for the freedom to be unpredictable.
I agree with Caleb that prediction markets are a fascinating tool for understanding what the world *thinks* will happen. But I will always be the guy watching the game, or the market, waiting for that beautiful, random moment that proves the "experts" and the algorithms wrong. That is where the real "reality" lives.
