AI as a Performance Partner, Not a Replacement
January 8, 2026
Artificial intelligence is often framed as something that will eventually replace human effort.
In classrooms, workplaces, and creative fields, people worry that relying on AI means losing
essential skills or becoming less capable. After watching a video by Jeffrey Wei, founder of
Laracasts, I came away with a very different perspective. Rather than seeing AI as a shortcut or
a threat, Wei presents it as a partner—one that enhances human performance without removing
purpose or meaning.
In the video, Wei explains how AI has changed the way he works as a programmer. Tasks that once
took hours of manual effort can now be completed faster, allowing him to focus on higher-level
thinking and creative problem-solving. What stood out most to me was his honesty about fear and
acceptance. Instead of resisting AI, he chose to adapt—and in doing so, he rediscovered enjoyment
in his work.
“I’m no longer trying to prove that I can do everything myself. I’m focused on what I can
build when I work with AI instead of against it.”

This quote captures the core idea of the video: AI does not eliminate human skill; it shifts where
that skill is applied. Wei still reviews code, makes decisions, and understands the systems he is
building. AI handles repetitive or time-consuming steps, but the responsibility and creativity
remain human.
AI and Performance: A Sports Mindset
As an athlete, this way of thinking feels familiar. Training tools, coaches, and technology
have always existed to support performance. None of them replace the athlete. A strength coach
cannot lift the weight for you, and a playbook cannot execute itself on the field. These tools
exist to guide, refine, and enhance human effort.
AI fits naturally into this framework. It is less like an opponent and more like a training
partner—something that helps you improve faster, notice patterns, and recover energy so you can
focus on execution. The work still requires discipline, judgment, and resilience. AI simply
removes unnecessary friction.
What Experts Say About AI and Human Judgment
This idea of AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement is supported by experts studying how
people actually use these tools. Ethan Mollick, a professor at the Wharton School who researches
AI and work, argues that AI is most powerful when it amplifies human capability instead of
replacing it.
“The real promise of AI isn’t automation—it’s augmentation. The biggest gains come when
humans stay in the loop and use AI as a partner.”
— Ethan Mollick, Wharton School of Business
This aligns closely with Wei’s experience. Both emphasize that humans remain responsible for
judgment, creativity, and ethical decision-making. AI can suggest, generate, and accelerate, but
it does not decide what matters. That role stays with people.
Why the Human Element Still Matters
One of the biggest fears surrounding AI is that it will make people lazy or less skilled. But
that assumes people stop engaging critically with the tools they use. In reality, using AI well
requires clarity, communication, and evaluation. You have to know what to ask, what to accept,
and what to reject.
In sports, performance often comes down to moments of pressure—split-second decisions that no
system can fully predict. In work and learning, the same is true. AI can provide options, but
humans choose direction. That choice is where growth happens.
Another important point is that AI can also improve performance by allowing people to learn faster.
When AI reduces repetitive tasks, it gives students and athletes more time to practice the skills
that actually matter. For example, instead of spending hours on a single coding bug or studying
one repetitive topic, AI can help summarize and organize information so the person can spend more
time on higher-level thinking. In the same way, athletes can use AI to analyze training data and
find patterns in their performance, then focus on improving specific weaknesses rather than wasting
energy on guesswork.
Conclusion: Choosing Partnership Over Fear
Watching Jeffrey Wei’s video helped reframe how I think about AI. Instead of viewing it as a
shortcut or a threat, I see it as a partner that can push me to perform at a higher level. Whether
in programming, athletics, or everyday problem-solving, AI works best when it supports—not
replaces—human effort.
The future is not about humans competing against machines. It is about learning how to work
alongside them. Like any good teammate or coach, AI is most effective when humans remain engaged,
intentional, and in control of the final outcome.
