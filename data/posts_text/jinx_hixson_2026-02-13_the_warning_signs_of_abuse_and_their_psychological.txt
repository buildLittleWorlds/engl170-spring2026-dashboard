The Warning Signs of Abuse and Their Psychological Toll
February 13, 2026
In my previous post, "Defining Healthy vs. Unhealthy Relationship Dynamics," I discussed how a healthy relationship enhances your agency rather than swallowing it. I noted that while unhealthy relationships are characterized by a lack of respect, they can quickly veer into abusive territory if the behaviors are not addressed. Today, I want to look specifically at the warning signs of domestic violence and the staggering effects these dynamics have on our mental and physical health, utilizing resources provided from the National Domestic Violence Hotline.
Defining Domestic Abuse
According to The National Domestic Violence Hotline, domestic violence (also referred to as intimate partner violence or relationship abuse) is a pattern of behaviors used by one partner to maintain power and control over another partner in an intimate relationship. This definition reinforces the idea that abuse is not just a single event, but a constant need for control that erodes a person's individuality. Abuse can happen to anyone, regardless of age, race, religion, or sexual orientation.
The National Domestic Violence Hotline identifies several types of abuse, including:
Physical Abuse: Any intentional use of physical force with the intent to cause fear or injury.
Emotional/Verbal Abuse: Non-physical behaviors such as threats, insults, constant monitoring, or gaslighting.
Sexual Abuse: Using tactics such as coersion, force, or pressure to control physical and sexual intimacy.
Digital Abuse: Using technologies like social media or GPS tracking to bully, harass, or intimidate a partner.
Financial Abuse: Preventing a partner from working or controlling their access to money to create dependency.
These behaviors are the antithesis of the "stable effects" we look for in healthy human connection. When power is used to dominate, the "biological necessity of connection" is replaced by a survival state of constant fear.
Identifying the Warning Signs
Recognizing domestic abuse warning signs is the first step toward reclaiming personal agency. Because abuse is about control, the red flags often start small escalating slowly over time. In many cases, the person being abused may feel like they are "walking on eggshells" in order to avoid an unpredictable outburst from their partner.
Common warning signs that a partner may be abusive include:
Insulting, demeaning, or shaming you with put-downs.
Extreme jealousy of your friends and family, or time spent away from them.
Preventing you from making your own decisions.
Controlling who you see, where you go, or what you do.
Pressuring you to do things you’re not comfortable with.
Intimidating you with guns, knives, or other weapons.
As I argued in my post on relationship dynamics, trust is the physiological buffer that protects us. In an abusive relationship, that buffer is destroyed. You cannot be truly vulnerable with someone who uses your history or your fears as a weapon of control.
The Staggering Reality: Domestic Violence Statistics
The statistics on domestic violence reveal a public health crisis that aligns with the CDC’s warnings about the risks of isolation and stress. According to data shared by The National Domestic Violence Hotline, an average of 24 people per minute are victims of rape, physical violence, or stalking by an intimate partner in the United States— over 12 million women and men over the course of a single year.
The long-term effects of this violence are devastating:
Survivors of domestic violence are three times more likely to meet the criteria for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).
51.1% of female rape victims reported being raped by an intimate partner.
Over 1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men in the US have experienced rape, physical violence, and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime.
When we look at these numbers, it becomes clear that human therapy and intervention still matter because they can provide the safety and resources that a machine is fundamentally incapable of offering.
"Relationship abuse is a pattern of behaviors used to gain or maintain power and control over a partner... Multiple types of abuse usually occur in an abusive relationship."

Reclaiming Safety and Agency
Treating the trauma of abuse requires the "hard work of change" and a safe, human-led environment. Unlike AI models that might validate a dangerous situation to keep a user engaged, a human therapist or advocate has the moral responsibility to intervene in these situations. As I've noted before, a machine can follow a procedure, but it cannot possess the moral agency required to pivot when a human life is on the line.
Reclaiming your life means setting boundaries and recognizing that everyone deserves to live free from fear. A healthy relationship should assist us in our growth, not diminish us through control. We must value the truth of human connection— the kind based on equality and shared presence— over the volatility of abusive dynamics. Our mental and physical survival depends on our ability to distinguish between a supportive bond and a control-driven trap.
If you or someone you know is experiencing an abusive relationship, there is help available. You are not alone, and it is not your fault. You deserve to be heard by a person who can provide a real presence and a real connection.
