The Cost of Human Relevancy: Why Efficiency Isn't the Only Metric
January 16, 2026
In the post "The Green Mask: What We’re Really Hiding Behind," the author presents a compelling, math-driven argument. By citing Dr. Plate’s data, they suggest that the environmental objections to AI are merely a "Green Mask"—a noble-sounding excuse used to hide a fear of "structural obsolescence." The author argues that we are clinging to "atoms" (books and physical classrooms) because we are afraid that "bits" (AI) will make our cognitive labor worthless.
The logic is sleek, but it rests on a dangerous premise: that the value of an activity is determined solely by its efficiency. While the author is right that a prompt is "cheaper" than a printed page in terms of carbon, they overlook the fact that progress at the cost of human relevancy has no merit.
The Fallacy of "Cheaper" Labor
The author argues that AI makes certain skills, like rote summarization, "worthless." But is the "worth" of a human skill only found in its market value or its speed? When we summarize a text, we aren't just "producing a summary"; we are engaging in the act of understanding. By outsourcing that to a chatbot because it is "cheaper," we are essentially paying for our own intellectual atrophy.
[ADD 200 WORDS HERE: Think about a time you had to work really hard to understand a difficult book or concept. If an AI had summarized it for you in 2 seconds, would you actually "know" the material? Why does the "struggle" matter for your brain?]
The Architecture of Authority vs. The Architecture of Learning
The "Green Mask" post suggests that we defend the book because it represents "established, verified, unchangeable truth" that supports our authority. However, I would argue that we defend the book because it demands something of the reader. A book is a conversation that requires your full attention. A chatbot is a service that requires only your request. Transitioning from "atoms to bits" isn't just a change in format; it is a change in the depth of our engagement.
"If the work is done by a machine, the person behind the machine isn't doing the work; they are just supervising its disappearance."
The Human Outside Source
This brings me to an outside perspective. [HERE, YOU SHOULD LINK TO AN OUTSIDE ARTICLE. For example, search for "Nicholas Carr - The Shallows" or an article about "Deskilling." You could write: "As Nicholas Carr argues in his work on how the internet affects our brains, the tools we use to find information actually change the way we think. If we move entirely to AI, we risk losing the ability to think deeply."]
Conclusion: Reclaiming the Mask
The author of "The Green Mask" tells us to have the courage to say, "I don't want to use this tool because it scares me." I will go a step further. We should have the courage to say, "I don't want to use this tool for this task because the task is where my growth happens."
Efficiency is a metric for machines. Relevancy, struggle, and growth are metrics for humans. If we retire the environmental argument, let’s not replace it with a blind worship of "bits." Let’s replace it with a fierce defense of the human mind’s right to do the work, even—and especially—when that work is "expensive."
