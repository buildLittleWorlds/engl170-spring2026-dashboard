[cite_start]The “Benito Bowl” Was a Statement, Not a Translation [cite: 1]
[cite_start]Last night’s Super Bowl LX was one for the history books[cite: 2]. [cite_start]While the Seahawks were busy dominating on the field, Bad Bunny was busy turning the halftime show into a massive cultural and political statement[cite: 3].
[cite_start]If you’ve been on social media today, you’ve seen the “hate” train in full effect[cite: 4]. [cite_start]People are complaining about the language barrier, calling the show “confusing,” or saying it didn’t feel “American” enough[cite: 5]. [cite_start]But let’s be real: the hate is completely undeserved[cite: 6]. [cite_start]Bad Bunny did exactly what Kendrick Lamar did last year—he used the world’s biggest stage to represent his people with zero apologies[cite: 6].
[cite_start]The “Political” Playbook: From Kendrick to Benito [cite: 7]
[cite_start]Last year, Kendrick Lamar told a deeply layered story about the Black American experience[cite: 8]. [cite_start]This year, Bad Bunny did the same for the Latino community[cite: 9]. [cite_start]By performing a set almost entirely in Spanish, he wasn’t “alienating” the audience; he was asserting that Spanish is an American language[cite: 10, 11].
[cite_start]The most emotional moment of the night was the tribute to Liam Conejo Ramos, the 5-year-old who was recently detained by ICE[cite: 12]. [cite_start]During a sequence where a family was shown watching the Grammys on an old-fashioned TV, Bad Bunny stepped into the frame and handed his actual Grammy Award to a young boy[cite: 13]. [cite_start]Even though the boy on stage was an actor (Lincoln Fox), the message was crystal clear: he was honoring Liam and every other family affected by the recent immigration raids[cite: 14]. [cite_start]It was a direct, “ICE out” statement that didn’t need a single word of English to be understood[cite: 15].
[cite_start]It’s About the Vibe, Not the Vocabulary [cite: 16]
[cite_start]For the people complaining they “couldn’t understand” the lyrics—honestly, since when do we need a dictionary to enjoy the Super Bowl? [cite: 17]
[cite_start]The Energy: The show was a non-stop party[cite: 18]. [cite_start]Between the domino players, the salsa remix of “Die With a Smile” with Lady Gaga, and the appearance by Ricky Martin, the energy was through the roof[cite: 18].
[cite_start]The Accessibility: If people really cared about the lyrics, there were English captions provided on the screen[cite: 19].
[cite_start]The Point: The goal wasn’t to give a lecture; it was to dance, have fun, and vibe[cite: 20]. [cite_start]Music is a universal language, and if you couldn’t feel the joy in that stadium, that’s on you[cite: 21].
[cite_start]Why the Hate is Misplaced [cite: 22]
[cite_start]The double standard is wild[cite: 23]. [cite_start]We’ve had decades of halftime shows with heavy pyrotechnics and mumble-singing where nobody complained about “understanding” the words[cite: 23]. [cite_start]The difference here is that Bad Bunny refused to “translate” himself to make people comfortable[cite: 24].
[cite_start]He climbed an electrical pole (a nod to the power grid issues in Puerto Rico), carried the flag of independence, and ended with a football that read “Together, We Are America”[cite: 25]. [cite_start]He proved that you don’t need to speak English to command the room[cite: 26].
