The Human Variable in Boxing: A Reply to Tom
January 30, 2026
In his recent post, Tom argues that AI is revolutionizing boxing by providing precision analytics and improving fighter safety[cite: 308, 309]. While the data-driven "Dashboard" Tom describes is impressive, I believe we must remain cautious of what I call the "Ghost in the Dashboard"—the human element that data cannot quantify.
The "10% Void" is the Ghost.
Algorithms and markets are built on fluency—they want the world to be smooth, logical, and binary. They see a 90% probability and call it "certainty." But in the grit of a championship round, that 10% is where heroism and faith actually live.
Tom points out that AI can predict punches and suggest defensive maneuvers. This provides what psychologists call "cognitive comfort." However, as I discussed in my response to Zay, if we successfully engineer out the "random hit" or the unpriced surge in effort, we don't just make things safer—we risk making them hollow.
Boxing is fundamentally a sport of risk and unpredictability. While AI can optimize a training camp, it cannot simulate the split-second decision-making driven by pure human instinct. The dashboard is a powerful tool, but it isn't the fight itself. I'll stay focused on the Ghost—the part of the athlete that refuses to be averaged into a metric.
