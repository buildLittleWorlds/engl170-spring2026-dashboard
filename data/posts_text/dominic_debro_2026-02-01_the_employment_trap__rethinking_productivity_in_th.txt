The Employment Trap: Rethinking Productivity in the Age of AI
February 1, 2026
For decades, the "job" has been the undisputed center of the human universe[cite: 2]. We have tied our identity, our healthcare, and our right to basic survival to the concept of labor[cite: 4]. However, we are reaching a breaking point where our economy prioritizes the mere existence of jobs over the actual impact those jobs have on the planet[cite: 5]. We have become so obsessed with "full employment" that we’ve stopped asking if the work we’re doing is actually worth doing[cite: 6].
The "Job for the Sake of a Job" Fallacy
In our current model, "job creation" is the ultimate political gold star[cite: 8]. Politicians are hailed as successes for creating 10,000 jobs, even if those roles are pointless or harmful[cite: 9]. This phenomenon was famously explored by anthropologist David Graeber in his theory of "Bullshit Jobs"[cite: 10]. Graeber argued that much of modern employment consists of roles that employees themselves believe are unnecessary, causing "moral and spiritual damage"[cite: 11].
This connects to a recent post by Dr. Plate, who explores how we define intellectual work in the age of automation[cite: 64]. If we only value work for the paycheck it provides, innovation stagnates[cite: 12, 14].
AI and the Liberation of Time
The prevailing narrative around Artificial Intelligence is one of pure dread[cite: 17]. The World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs Report 2025 notes that while 170 million new roles may emerge, roughly 92 million jobs will be displaced by 2030[cite: 18]. However, if a machine can do a job, it means that task is mechanical enough to be automated[cite: 20]. This isn't a failure of technology; it's a massive advancement for the human race[cite: 21].
Economists Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee identified "The Great Decoupling," where productivity rises due to technology while employment stagnates[cite: 22]. This shows we are getting better at creating value without needing human drudgery[cite: 23]. The true advancement is the liberation of human time[cite: 24].
Less Work, More Progress
The fear of job loss is actually a fear of poverty, not a fear of leisure[cite: 28]. If we decoupled survival from labor—perhaps through a Universal Basic Income (UBI)—a world with "less jobs to worry about" would be a golden age[cite: 31]. People could focus on:
Community building and environmental restoration[cite: 33].
Arts, philosophy, and scientific inquiry[cite: 34].
Meaningful care for children and the elderly[cite: 35].
The real challenge of the 21st century isn't "saving" jobs that AI can do better; it's redesigning our society so that when the machines take the work, the people get the benefits[cite: 44, 45].
