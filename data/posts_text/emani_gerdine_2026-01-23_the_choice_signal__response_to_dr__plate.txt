The Choice Signal: Who Really Sets the Price?
January 23, 2026
In my latest exploration of "The Agency Paradox," I came across an entry on the Plate Composition blog titled “The Price Signal,” and it got me thinking about the central theme of this blog: Agency.
When we see a Taylor Swift ticket listed for $800, our immediate reaction is a sense of powerlessness. We feel like the system has taken away our agency to enjoy art at a fair price. But "The Price Signal" suggests something different: that the price isn't a villain—it's a messenger.
The Agency of the Crowd
The article points out that high prices exist because millions of people want those seats. In a way, the price is the ultimate expression of collective agency. It’s the sum total of thousands of individual choices. If we capped the price, we wouldn't be fixing the value; we would just be changing who loses their agency to get a seat.
The Paradox of Value
The paradox here is that while we want the freedom to buy what we love at a "fair" price, that very freedom is what drives prices up when everyone else wants the same thing. As I track the "Agency Paradox" for ENGL 170, it becomes clear that we can't ignore the market's role as a reflection of us.
What do you think? Is the price a signal of our collective freedom, or a barrier to it?
