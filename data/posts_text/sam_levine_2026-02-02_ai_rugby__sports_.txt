AI in Rugby: Performance Partner or Threat to Autonomy?
AI in Rugby: Performance Partner or Threat to Autonomy?
February 2026
In my previous blog post, “AI as a Performance Partner, Not a Replacement,”
I explored the growing cultural anxiety that artificial intelligence will eventually replace
human effort, creativity, and skill. In many conversations about AI, the technology is framed
as something that removes meaning from work and makes people less capable. However, I argued
that this perspective misses the more important truth: AI is not necessarily a substitute for
human ability, but rather a tool that can amplify it.
I was especially drawn to the idea that AI works best when it is treated as a collaborator.
Instead of seeing it as a shortcut or a threat, I suggested that AI can function like a partner
that reduces unnecessary friction and allows people to focus on higher-level decision-making.
This idea applies not only to programming or academics, but also to athletics, where training
has always involved tools designed to enhance performance.
“I’m no longer trying to prove that I can do everything myself. I’m focused on what I can build
when I work with AI instead of against it.”
— Jeffrey Wei, quoted in my earlier post
That quote captured what I found most compelling about AI: it does not erase human purpose,
but shifts where human skill is applied. People remain responsible for judgment, creativity,
and ethical decision-making. AI may accelerate repetitive tasks, but it does not decide what
matters or what direction to take.
This framework becomes even more complex when we move from the world of programming into the
world of sport, especially a collision sport like rugby. Rugby is not simply about efficiency
or output. It is a sport defined by instinct, physical courage, and split-second decision-making.
In that context, the introduction of AI raises a deeper question: does using AI in sports training
enhance human performance, or does it threaten human autonomy?
AI Enters the Rugby World
A recent external source that brings this question into focus is an article published by
Trinity College Dublin describing an AI research project designed to improve rugby players’
tackle technique. Tackling is one of the most essential skills in rugby, but it is also one
of the most dangerous. Concussions and head injuries remain ongoing concerns across the sport,
from youth rugby to the professional level.
According to the Trinity College Dublin article, researchers are developing AI tools that can
analyze video footage of tackles, identify patterns in technique, and provide insights that
coaches or players may not easily recognize through observation alone.
“AI research to improve players’ tackle technique” aims to support safer outcomes by analyzing
tackle events through video and data-driven feedback.
— Trinity College Dublin, School of Computer Science and Statistics
The promise of this work is significant. Rugby tackling happens at high speed, often with
bodies moving unpredictably. Even experienced coaches cannot always detect every subtle detail
of head placement, shoulder position, or timing. AI systems, however, can process enormous
amounts of footage and potentially recognize recurring risky habits much faster than a human
analyst reviewing film manually.
In this sense, AI is not being positioned as a replacement for athletes or coaches. Instead,
it functions as a feedback tool—something that highlights patterns and supports improvement.
This aligns with the broader argument I made in my earlier post: AI is most effective when it
augments human ability rather than eliminating it.
Why AI in Rugby Training Can Be Revolutionary
One of the strongest arguments in favor of AI-driven rugby training is that it has the potential
to make the sport safer. Rugby is a game of physical contact, and tackling will always be part
of its identity. But reducing preventable injury is essential for the sport’s future.
If AI can help identify dangerous tackle patterns early—especially among younger athletes—then
it may protect players from long-term damage. In this way, AI could preserve careers, reduce
concussions, and allow athletes to continue playing the sport they love.
Additionally, AI may help athletes train smarter. Rather than relying purely on trial and error,
players could receive more specific guidance about weaknesses in their technique. Coaches could
use AI insights to tailor training sessions, focusing on areas where athletes are most at risk
or most likely to improve.
This is why I believe AI is revolutionary in sport: not because it removes the human element,
but because it strengthens and protects it. Rugby will always require courage, discipline, and
instinct. AI cannot replace those qualities. But it may help athletes refine them more safely
and effectively.
The Fear of Losing Human Autonomy
Despite these benefits, it is understandable why some critics feel uneasy. Rugby is not simply
a sport of mechanics. It is deeply tied to human instinct and decision-making. Tackles are not
executed in controlled laboratory conditions—they happen in chaotic moments where athletes must
react instantly.
Because of this, some people worry that increased reliance on AI could reduce autonomy. If players
begin training according to algorithmic feedback, does rugby become less creative and more
standardized? Do athletes lose the ability to trust their own instincts?
There is also the broader cultural fear that technology can slowly shift from being a tool into
being an authority. Coaches might begin deferring too heavily to data-driven recommendations.
Players might feel pressured to conform to an “ideal” movement model rather than developing their
own style of play.
These concerns are not irrational. Sport is meaningful partly because it is unpredictable, human,
and emotionally charged. If AI becomes overly dominant, some fear rugby could lose part of its
identity.
Autonomy Is Not the Absence of Tools
However, I would argue that these fears misunderstand what autonomy truly means. Autonomy does
not require athletes to act without support. Rugby has never been a sport of pure independence.
Players rely on teammates, coaches, trainers, nutrition plans, film review, and strength programs.
All of these tools shape performance, yet none of them erase the athlete’s humanity.
AI should be understood in the same way. It does not tackle for the player. It does not decide
strategy. It does not replace courage or instinct. Instead, it provides information that athletes
can choose to use. The athlete remains in control of the final outcome.
In fact, AI may actually increase autonomy by giving players more knowledge about their own bodies
and movements. With better feedback, athletes can make more informed decisions about how to train
and how to protect themselves.
Limitations and Open Questions
At the same time, it is important to acknowledge limitations. The Trinity College Dublin article
describes a research project rather than presenting completed results. The long-term impact will
depend on whether these AI systems are accurate, widely accessible, and used responsibly.
Another concern is inequality. If AI-based tackle analysis becomes available only to elite programs,
it could widen the gap between professional rugby and grassroots levels. Community clubs may not
have the same resources, meaning the benefits could be unevenly distributed.
Ethical questions also remain about data privacy and how player footage is collected and used.
These are issues the article does not address in detail, but they will matter as AI becomes more
common in sport.
Conclusion: Partnership Over Fear
Ultimately, the Trinity College Dublin research reinforces the argument I made in my earlier post:
AI is most powerful when it is treated as a performance partner, not a replacement. Rugby will
always remain a deeply human sport, shaped by instinct, courage, and split-second decisions. AI
cannot remove those qualities.
Instead, AI has the potential to revolutionize rugby by making it safer and smarter. The real
challenge is not whether AI eliminates autonomy, but whether humans remain intentional about how
they use it. Autonomy is lost only when athletes stop making the final decisions. When AI is used
responsibly, it becomes not a threat, but a tool that protects the very human element that makes
sport meaningful.
The future of rugby is not humans competing against machines. It is humans learning how to work
alongside them—using technology to preserve both performance and humanity.
