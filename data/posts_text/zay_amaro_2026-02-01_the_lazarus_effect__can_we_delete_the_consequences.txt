The Lazarus Effect: Can We Delete the Consequences of Randomness?
February 1, 2026
In his most provocative post yet, "The Lazarus Protocol," Jacob Brunts explores a future where medical AI doesn't just treat injuries—it reverses them. He describes a world where career-ending tears and "random" physical failures are met with a protocol designed to restore an athlete to 100% functionality, effectively cheating the biological clock. While Jacob frames this as the ultimate triumph of human ingenuity, I find myself looking at it through the lens of sports narrative: If there is no such thing as a "permanent" injury, does the drama of the game survive?
Jacob’s vision is one where data and biology merge to create a safety net so strong that the "random" element of physical breakdown is essentially deleted. In my previous posts, I’ve argued that the threat of injury is one of the few things that keeps sports "human" in an era of hyper-calculated stats. If we implement a "Lazarus Protocol," we aren't just fixing hamstrings; we are removing the stakes. We are moving from "Any Given Sunday" to "Any Given Sunday (With a Reset Button)."
The Death of the "What If?"
Sports history is built on "What Ifs." What if Gale Sayers never hurt his knee? What if Bo Jackson stayed healthy? These moments of randomness are tragic, but they provide the contrast that makes healthy greatness so impressive. Jacob’s post suggests a future where these questions are obsolete. Because the "Lazarus" AI can process billions of data points to regenerate tissue, the randomness of a bad landing or a blindside hit loses its power to change the course of history. We are effectively "optimizing" the tragedy out of the sport.
As noted in a Nature article on AI in regenerative medicine, the ability to predict how cells will respond to treatment is revolutionizing recovery. But when we apply this to the NFL or boxing, we run into the "Human Relevancy" problem Gabriel Bell wrote about. If an athlete is essentially a "Lazarus" who can always be brought back to peak performance, the struggle to stay at the top feels less like a feat of faith and discipline and more like a scheduled maintenance check.
The Final Limit of the Stats
I agree with Jacob that the "Lazarus Protocol" represents a massive leap forward for human health. No one wants to see an athlete’s life ruined by a single play. But from a fan's perspective, I worry that we are trading the soul of the sport for a "solved" biological equation. When randomness is removed, the game becomes a simulation where the most efficient "Lazarus" always wins. My faith tells me that the beauty of life—and sports—is found in the fact that our time is limited and our bodies are fragile. It’s that fragility that makes a 4th-quarter comeback feel like a miracle.
If we delete the consequences of randomness, do we delete the need for faith? I suspect that even with the best AI protocols, there will always be a "ghost in the machine"—a moment that no Lazarus can fix. And that’s exactly where I’ll be watching.
