Disney Imagineers face a similar, albeit less lethal, version of this problem. When Disney designs a ride like Avatar Flight of Passage or TRON Lightcycle / Run, they are designing for a global audience. If their sensors or restraint systems only account for the "average" body type, they don't just exclude people—they create safety hazards.
The "Edge Case" as the Main Event
