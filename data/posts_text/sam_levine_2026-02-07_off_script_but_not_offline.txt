Off-Script, But Not Offline
In his post “The Off-Script Athlete: Why We Need Moral Agency in Sports,” Zay Amaro
argues that automation threatens the meaning of sport by removing human accountability.
According to Zay, when sports rely too heavily on systems and sensors, victories risk feeling
calculated rather than earned.
“When we replace a human umpire with a sensor, we gain accuracy but we lose ‘moral agency’—the
human accountability that makes a victory feel earned rather than calculated.”
— Zay Amaro
I agree with Zay’s core concern. Sports matter because humans make choices, take risks, and live
with consequences. But I want to push back on the idea that automation necessarily erases moral
agency. In my view, automation can still be useful—even in high-stakes moments—when it
works alongside human judgment rather than replacing it.
When Human Error Overpowers Human Meaning
Zay emphasizes the importance of humans going “off-script” when rules and patterns fall short.
That improvisation is essential to sport. However, not every deviation adds meaning. When a
championship game is decided by a call that replay clearly shows to be wrong, the focus shifts
away from athletic excellence and toward officiating failure.
In those moments, accountability feels less like moral agency and more like arbitrariness.
This is where automation can serve as a fairness tool rather than a replacement for human
judgment. By catching clear mistakes, technology ensures that the human story is about the
athletes’ performance rather than preventable errors.
For example, imagine a World Series game tied in the bottom of the ninth inning. A borderline
pitch is called a strike when replays show it was outside. The batter strikes out, and the
championship hinges on that single call. Even if the umpire acted with integrity, the result
could feel unfair. In such moments, automation doesn’t remove human agency—it protects the
fairness that makes human decisions meaningful.
Automation as Assistance, Not Authority
Major League Baseball’s upcoming Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) system provides
a real-world example of how technology can enhance fairness without replacing humans. Beginning
in the 2026 season, MLB will allow players to challenge ball-and-strike calls using automated
pitch-tracking technology—while keeping human umpires on the field.
“Human umpires will still call balls and strikes, but players will be able to challenge those
calls using the automated system.”

This system preserves human agency. Umpires make the initial call. Players decide when to
challenge. Coaches manage strategy. Automation only intervenes when a human actively chooses
to use it. This creates a hybrid model where technology improves accuracy but humans still
control the narrative and moral responsibility.
Hybrid systems like ABS also introduce strategic decision-making. Coaches and players must
weigh when to use their limited challenges, adding layers of human judgment and risk
management that automation alone cannot replicate. Far from erasing the “off-script” element,
this approach makes strategic choices more deliberate and impactful.
High Stakes Demand Both Precision and Judgment
Zay suggests that high-stakes moments demand human discretion. I agree—but I would add that
high stakes also demand higher standards of fairness. The more meaningful the moment, the more
damaging an uncorrected error becomes. Automation in these scenarios ensures that the outcome
reflects skill and performance rather than mistakes anyone could prevent.
Beyond baseball, other sports already employ similar technology to balance fairness and
agency. Tennis uses Hawk-Eye for line calls, soccer uses VAR for goal-line and penalty
decisions, and football uses replay challenges to correct obvious errors. In all these cases,
technology does not remove human responsibility—it supports it, ensuring that the story is
about human skill.
ABS in MLB follows this same principle. By correcting objectively wrong calls while leaving
the initial call to the umpire and the decision to challenge to players, the system strengthens
the legitimacy of high-stakes moments without reducing the human drama that makes sports
meaningful.
Conclusion: Agency With Assistance
Fully automated sports would strip away dialogue, discretion, and accountability. But rejecting
automation entirely risks preserving error in the name of tradition. Hybrid systems like MLB’s
ABS offer a more promising path—one where automation supports precision while
humans retain responsibility.
Moral agency doesn’t disappear when technology enters the game. It disappears only when humans
are removed from decision-making. As long as humans remain accountable for their choices, sports
remain human—even in a world where technology can help prevent mistakes.
In short, automation and human judgment don’t have to be enemies. When carefully designed to
complement each other, they ensure that victories are both fair and earned, preserving the
drama, strategy, and moral agency that make sports compelling.
