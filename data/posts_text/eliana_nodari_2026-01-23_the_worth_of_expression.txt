The Worth of Expression
January 23, 2026
The essay "The Price of Everything and the Value of Nothing" by Gabriel Bell provides a chillingly accurate diagnosis of our current era: we are fluent in the language of cost but increasingly illiterate in the language of worth. While the author expertly outlines the "Great Divide" between use value and exchange value, nowhere is this tension more visible—or more high-stakes—than in the realm of Art. If we allow the market to be the sole arbiter of art’s importance, we don't just lose money; we lose the "innate humanity" that makes art a necessity rather than a luxury.
Art Beyond the Ledger: The Worth of the Inexpressible
The essay quotes Oscar Wilde, who famously quipped about the cynic knowing the price of everything and the value of nothing. In the art market, this cynicism manifests as the "Financialization of Aesthetics". When a painting is tucked away in a climate-controlled tax haven to appreciate in value rather than being hung on a wall to be seen, its Exchange Value has completely devoured its Use Value.
Art's true worth is found in its ability to:
Challenge Perception: It forces us to see the world through a lens other than our own.
Foster Empathy: It bridges the gap between disparate human experiences.
Record History: Not just the facts of history, but the feeling of it.
These are "incommensurable" qualities. You cannot calculate the ROI of a poem that prevents a reader from feeling alone, just as you cannot find the market value of the "sentimental anchor" mentioned in the essay. To price these things is to misunderstand their purpose entirely.
The Robot’s Limitation: Expression vs. Simulation
As we navigate an increasingly digitized world, we must confront the rise of Generative AI. While a machine can produce a visually stunning image in seconds, it lacks the fundamental requirement of true art: subjective experience. Art is, at its core, a form of human expression, and a robot simply cannot replace the artist because a robot cannot feel.
A machine does not know the sting of pain, the lightness of happiness, or the crushing weight of grief. It can only simulate the symptoms of these emotions by analyzing data. When a human creator pours their lived experience into a work, they are inviting the audience into a shared biological reality. AI-generated art is a hollow echo—a statistical arrangement of pixels lacking emotional intentionality. Because there is no "self" behind the machine, there is no true communication.
The AI Mirage: Why Humanity is Not a "Prompt"
If a machine can produce a visually stunning image in seconds, why does it often feel hollow? The "innate humanity" of art isn't just about the final aesthetic output; it’s about the process and the individuality of the person.
The Value of Struggle and Intent: AI operates on statistical probability—it predicts the next most likely pixel or word based on a massive dataset of human effort. It has no "intent". When we look at a Van Gogh, we aren't just looking at yellow paint; we are looking at a man’s specific, desperate attempt to capture the vibrating intensity of a summer day.
Art as a Social Contract: Art is a form of communication between two conscious minds. AI cannot feel, so its "art" is a one-way mirror. Replacing human artists with AI for the sake of "efficiency" is the ultimate example of "hyper-commodification"—it treats creativity as a commodity to be harvested rather than a connection to be cherished.
Conclusion: Protecting the Intrinsic
"Reclaiming the narrative" means refusing to let algorithms or auction houses define what is beautiful or significant. We must protect art as a "prerequisite for life" in the same way the essay argues for a stable atmosphere. If we outsource our creative spirit to machines because it is "cheaper," we are being cynical. We are choosing the price of the tool over the value of the human voice.
