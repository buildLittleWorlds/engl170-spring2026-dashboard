The Internal Loop: Treating "Pure O" OCD with a "Low-Ceiling Lifestyle"
January 26, 2026
In my last post, I discussed how AI acts as a "reassurance engine" for those struggling with OCD. Following that, my classmate Dominic Debro offered a "shelter" from this storm in his latest post, "Beyond the Screen: Cultivating a Low-Ceiling Lifestyle." Dominic’s strategies for lowering our biological dopamine baseline provide a perfect toolkit for a specific, often misunderstood subtype of this disorder; "Pure O" OCD.
What is "Pure O"?
According to the clinical experts at Therapy MN, "Pure O" stands for Purely Obsessional OCD. Unlike the more commonly recognized versions of OCD— where a person might obsessively wash their hands or check a lock— Pure O is characterized by "invisible" compulsions. The person experiences intrusive, distressing thoughts (obsessions) and then performs mental rituals (compulsions) to neutralize the anxiety.
Some of these mental compulsions include:
Mental Reassurance: Constantly replaying a memory to "prove" you didn't do something wrong.
Mental Review: Going over a conversation again and again to check for mistakes.
Ruminating: Attempting to "solve" a thought by thinking about it for hours.
Because these behaviors happen entirely inside the head, they are incredibly "loud" to the person experiencing them, even if they can appear perfectly calm on the outside. Because these obsessive thoughts often involve distressing, shameful, and even illegal content, most people suffering from this disease often keep these thoughts to themselves. Most "Pure O" sufferers aren't even aware that they have this disease- as it's symptoms don't line up with the societal preconception of what OCD "looks like."
The Pure O Dopamine Trap
This is where Dominic’s "Dopamine Ceiling" theory comes into play. As Dominic notes, when we "stack" dopamine— seeking high-intensity hits of relief— our brains adapt by lowering our dopamine sensitivity over time. To those struggling with "Pure O," the mental compulsion provides a hit of relief. However, in the "Loud Lie Economy," we often turn to digital tools (such as search engines or chatbots) to satisfy these mental rituals.
Asking an AI to "fact-check" an intrusive thought or scrolling through social media to find someone with the same worry provides a 10/10 hit of intensity. This raises the "dopamine ceiling." As the ceiling rises, the "grey and insufficient" reality of the physical world cannot compete with the vivid, terrifying, and distressing world of our intrusive thoughts. We become addicted to the high-intensity cycle of the obsession, making the "Pure O" loop nearly impossible to break without an intentional reset.
"If Jinx identified the 'perfect storm' of digital compulsions, I want to offer the shelter from it. The antidote is intentionally seeking out the 'boring'—the low-intensity, deeply human activities that ground us."
— Dominic Debro, "Beyond the Screen"
The Treatment: Reintroducing Friction
Therapy MN explains that the gold standard for treating Pure O is Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP). This involves exposing yourself to the scary thought and refusing to do the mental compulsion that follows. Dominic’s "low-ceiling" lifestyle offers a practical way to perform ERP in our digital lives through the concept of "digital friction."
Dominic’s 20-Minute Rule is a perfect ERP exercise for Pure O. When an intrusive thought strikes and you feel the "compulsion" to seek reassurance through AI or loved ones, ruminate, or checking your body's reactions to the thought, you set a timer and sit with the uncertainty for 20 minutes. This forces the brain to experience the anxiety without the "hit" of reassurance, eventually allowing the distress to subside on its own. It's actually one of the best way to build the "self-soothing muscles" required for recovery.
Grounding the Invisible Mind
Because Pure O happens in the vacuum of the mind, sensory grounding is essential. Dominic suggests engaging in "1/10 intensity activities" like gardening, petting a dog, or consuming physical media (physical books, vinyls, etc.) These activities are the opposite of an intrusive thought— they're tactile, slow, and anchored in the present.
Therapy MN emphasizes that recovery from Pure O is about learning that "thoughts are just thoughts." By adopting Dominic's grayscale shift on our devices and eliminating "dopamine stacking," we can begin to turn down our reliance on the digital world. This lowers our dopamine ceiling and makes our own, quiet, internal voice audible again. When the external world is no longer screaming at 10/10 intensity, our intrusive thoughts lose some of their power to shock us.
Reclaiming the Quiet
Treating Pure O isn't just about stopping a thought; it's about changing our relationship with stimulation. We have to learn to be uncomfortable and anxious again, without reaching for a machine or a mental ritual to provide a quick fix. Dominic’s "low-ceiling lifestyle" provides the architecture to begin that recovery.
By choosing the "boring" path— reading a physical book, practicing box breathing, or simply gazing out a window— we allow our dopamine baseline to recover. We prove to our brains that we don't need the "loud" hit of reassurance to be safe. We find the ability to let a thought exist without needing to solve it. Only then, as Dominic beautifully puts it, can the real world finally be loud enough to hear.
