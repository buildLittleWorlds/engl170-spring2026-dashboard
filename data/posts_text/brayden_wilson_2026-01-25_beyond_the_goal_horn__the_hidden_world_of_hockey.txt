When you’re sitting in the stands or watching from your couch, hockey looks like a seamless blur of speed and precision. However, the 60 minutes on the clock are just the tip of the iceberg. Behind the locker room doors, a highly coordinated world of "unsung heroes" keeps the game moving.
The Equipment Room: A 24/7 Operation
Equipment managers are often the first in and last to leave. They manage everything from the "Blade Masters" who sharpen skates to specific hollows, to the specialized high-speed dryers that ensure players don't have to step back into wet gear between periods.
