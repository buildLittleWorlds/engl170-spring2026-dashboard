The Agency Paradox: Choosing My Path
January 16, 2026
What is the Agency Paradox?
In my ENGL 170 class, we are exploring the Agency Paradox. At its simplest, agency is our ability to act and make choices. The "paradox" is that while we think we are in total control, our choices are often shaped by our environment, our families, and even our biology.
My Personal Connection
When I first heard this term, I immediately thought of my journey toward becoming a Physical Therapist.
I didn't just wake up one day and decide on this career out of nowhere. My agency was shaped by a major life event: my mother's knee surgeries. Being there for her appointments and watching her work to regain her mobility was the "external force" that guided my "internal choice."
The Paradox in the Clinic
In Physical Therapy, the paradox is everywhere:
The Body's Limits: A patient has the will to walk (agency), but their injured anatomy is an "external" constraint they cannot simply ignore.
The Role of the Guide: As a future PT, I will be an external force in my patients' lives. My job is to give them the tools to regain their own agency.
Why This Matters for My Blog
This page, which I've titled "The Agency Paradox," is where I will document my growth as a student and a future professional. Whether I'm studying Kinesiology, tackling Statistics homework, or learning about Nutrition, I am constantly looking at how we can overcome the things that limit us.
Through this blog, I want to show that even when we are facing a "paradox"—where we feel stuck or limited—we still have the power to move forward.
