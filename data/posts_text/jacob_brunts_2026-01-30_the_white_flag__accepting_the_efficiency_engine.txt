The White Flag: Accepting the Efficiency Engine
January 30, 2026
Response to: I'm Done (Jeffrey Way, Laracasts)
For years, Jeffrey Way has been a titan in the world of web development education. His platform, Laracasts, has taught hundreds of thousands of developers how to write clean, elegant code, line by painstaking line. His business model was built on the premise that learning syntax and architectural patterns was the ultimate barrier to entry in software engineering.
Last week, Jeffrey posted a video with a stark title: "I'm Done."
He isn't done programming. He is done fighting. In a deeply honest confession, Way outlines the paradox of the current moment. On one hand, AI has devastated his traditional business model. Because developers now ask AI agents to write code instead of watching tutorials, Way had to lay off 40% of his staff. That is the brutal reality of technological disruption.
But on the other hand, Way admits something equally powerful: he has never had more fun programming. The AI has removed the drudgery—the debugging headaches, the boilerplate typing—and left him with pure problem-solving. He is "done" lamenting the past and has fully accepted that AI is the permanent future of his industry.
Way has reached the acceptance stage of grief regarding generative AI. His video is a crucial signal flare for the rest of the professional world. It is time to stop debating if AI will take over and start figuring out how to survive when it does.
The Two Truths of Automation
Way’s video perfectly captures the dual nature of this revolution, something critics often struggle to hold in their heads simultaneously. Two things are true at once:
AI will cause significant, painful displacement in the job market.
AI will radically increase individual efficiency and creative potential.
The doom-sayers focus only on point one. The hype-artists focus only on point two. A mature perspective requires acknowledging both. Way admits that the AI revolution forced him to "wreck some people" financially by laying them off. We cannot sugarcoat the fact that efficiency often comes at the cost of headcount in the short term.
However, Way also notes that his remaining, smaller team has "released more content and courses... in the last 3 months than we ever have in any 3 month span in the history of Laracasts." This is the efficiency dividend. The AI acts as a force multiplier, allowing a smaller group of people to achieve massive scale.
The End of "Vibe Coding"
Crucially, Way argues against what he calls "vibe coding"—the practice of blindly trusting whatever code the AI spits out. He notes that while AI code technically works, it is often messy or over-complicated.
This reinforces a point I made in my very first post, The Obsolescence Trap. The role of the human is not disappearing; it is moving up the stack. Way now spends his time planning features, interviewing AI agents to refine those plans, and then rigorously auditing the output. He has moved from being a bricklayer to being an architect.
This is the new skillset. The future belongs not to the person who can write the fastest syntax, but to the person who has the deep domain knowledge required to look at an AI's output and say, "That's inefficient; do it this way instead." Deep knowledge is more valuable than ever, because it is the only defense against mediocre automated output.
The Great Bifurcation
Way concludes with a simple phrase: "It is what it is." He argues that this is not a trend, but a permanent shift in how work gets done. This leads to an inevitable conclusion about the future of the economy.
We are facing a great bifurcation. On one side, there will be individuals and businesses who, like Way, accept the reality, endure the painful transition, and learn to wield these tools as exoskeletons for their intellect. They will achieve levels of productivity that seem impossible today.
On the other side, there will be those who refuse. They will refuse on moral grounds, arguing that AI is theft. They will refuse on nostalgic grounds, arguing that "doing it the hard way" builds character. They will refuse out of fear.
Unfortunately, the market does not care about nostalgia. A business that refuses to use AI to optimize its supply chain, generate its marketing copy, or write its code will simply be slower and more expensive than its competitors. As Way notes, if you choose not to get on board, "you're gonna watch so many other people... fly right by you."
Jeffrey Way waved the white flag, not in surrender, but in recognition of reality. The war against the machine is over. The war for relevance has just begun.
