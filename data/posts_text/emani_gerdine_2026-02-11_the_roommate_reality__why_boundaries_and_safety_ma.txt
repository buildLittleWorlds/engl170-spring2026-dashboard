The Roommate Reality: Why Boundaries and Safety Matter
February 11, 2026
Following up on my last post about dorm living, I want to talk about the hardest part for most of us: roommates. It's a challenge because everyone is raised differently. You have neat people who take pride in a clean space—and personally, that is me—and then you have people who expect you to clean up after them. It's not okay; I'm your roommate, not your parent.
The Conflict of Schedules
It's also difficult when sleep schedules don't match. You have the night owls who stay up all night and never make it to class, while others are in bed by 10 or 11 to be ready for an early morning. It becomes a major issue when people are loud in the room while someone else is trying to sleep. It's disrespectful and makes it impossible to feel rested in your own home.
Safety is Not Optional
We need proper boundaries when it comes to who is in our rooms. I don't think it's ever okay to leave doors unlocked. Everyone knowing where you lay your head at is a huge safety issue, especially if your roommate doesn't take it seriously or allows anyone into the space. You should feel secure where you sleep, and that means locking the door every single time you leave.
The Bottom Line: Respecting someone's space, their sleep, and their safety should be common sense. If we had more privacy and our own rooms, these conflicts wouldn't be standing in the way of our peace of mind.
Have you ever had a roommate who didn't respect the "lock the door" rule? How did you handle it?
