The New Sincerity: Being "Too Much" in a World of Not Enough
February 12, 2026
If you’ve been following my last few posts, you know I’ve been obsessing over the "Human Premium" and the massive cultural backlash against the "perfect" AI-generated aesthetic[cite: 3]. But there’s a specific movement happening in the scene right now that goes beyond just a "backlash"[cite: 4]. It’s a full-on embrace of Radical Authenticity[cite: 5].
While AI is being trained to be calculated, safe, and "likable," the most exciting artists right now are leaning into being "cringe," "ugly," and—most importantly—"too much"[cite: 6]. We are moving away from the polished, over-calculated pop of the last decade and into an era of The New Sincerity[cite: 7].
1. The Death of the "Safe" Average
The problem with generative AI is that it is inherently a "search for the average"[cite: 9]. It scrapes millions of data points to find the most statistically probable next note[cite: 10]. It is the literal definition of "playing it safe"[cite: 11].
In response, artists like Mk.gee and Dijon are doing the exact opposite[cite: 12]. They are making music that feels like it’s held together by duct tape and sheer willpower[cite: 13]. Mk.gee’s guitar tone isn't "perfect"—it’s brittle, wobbling, and processed through gear that sounds like it’s on the verge of a short circuit[cite: 14]. When you hear him play, you aren't hearing a "clean" signal; you’re hearing the physical limitation of the equipment and the specific, erratic touch of his hands[cite: 15, 16]. It’s un-optimizable[cite: 16].
2. The Power of the "Messy" Performance
I mentioned Geese in my last post, but they really are the poster children for this "ultra-human" performance style[cite: 18]. Their latest records and live sets are chaotic, blending 70s art-rock with a vocal delivery that sounds like a manic episode[cite: 19].
This is the counter-culture in practice. In a world where an algorithm can generate a "pleasant" vocal melody, the only way to stand out is to be unpleasant in a way that feels honest[cite: 20]. Dijon’s live-in-the-room sessions (like the Absolutely film) aren't just about the songs; they’re about the sweat, the shouting, and the visual of six guys crowded around a table trying to catch a vibe[cite: 21, 22].
"You can't prompt 'the feeling of five friends losing their minds in a basement.' You have to actually be there." [cite: 23, 24]
3. Why "Cringe" is a Defense Mechanism
In the age of AI, "sincerity" is a radical act[cite: 26]. To be deeply, embarrassingly yourself is a defense mechanism against being "scraped"[cite: 27]. If you are too weird, too specific, or too emotional, the algorithm can’t find the "average" version of you to copy[cite: 28]. We are seeing a return to:
Site-Specific Sound: Recording in rooms with bad acoustics because it adds a "thumbprint" of a real place[cite: 30].
Micro-Dynamics: The tiny, unintentional volume shifts in a live performance that a human ear craves but a "maximized" AI track flattens out[cite: 31].
Radical Vulnerability: Writing lyrics that are so specific to a personal, human experience that they feel "wrong" in a commercial sense[cite: 32].
Final Thoughts on the Trilogy
The "Slot-Machine Symphony" Jonas warned us about is definitely playing in the background of our lives[cite: 34]. But for those of us actually making and obsessing over music, the machine has actually done us a favor[cite: 35]. It has cleared out the "background noise" and forced us to remember what we actually liked about music in the first place: the fact that it’s a window into another person’s messy, complicated, and totally un-optimized soul[cite: 36].
The future of music isn't about being better than the machine; it’s about being more human than the machine[cite: 37, 38].
