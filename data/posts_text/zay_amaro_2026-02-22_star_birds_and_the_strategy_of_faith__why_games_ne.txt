Star Birds and the Strategy of Faith: Why Games Need the Human Choice
February 22, 2026
In a refreshing break from sports analytics, my classmate Jake reviewed the game *Star Birds*, a resource-management game by the creators of Kurzgesagt. Jake describes a game where you explore asteroids, collect resources, and use a "dictionary of recipes" to build machines. While Jake focused on the beautiful art and relaxing gameplay, I couldn't help but see a parallel to my season-long exploration of AI. In *Star Birds*, the dictionary tells you *how* to build, but it doesn't tell you *where* to go or *why* you should survive. That is the human element—the "Taste" that Jonas Rodrigues wrote about, applied to the void of space.
Jake notes that the game is a hybrid of a tycoon and survival game. In a tycoon game, everything is about efficiency—maximizing output and reducing waste. This is exactly what Sam Levine warned about in his post on the "Efficiency Trap." If we played *Star Birds* with a perfect AI bot, the bot would find the most efficient path to harvest every asteroid. The "randomness" of discovery would be replaced by the "fluency" of a solved algorithm. But as Jake points out, the fun of the game is the exploration and the complexity. We play because we want to see what's on the next asteroid, not just to watch a machine reach a high score.
The Dictionary vs. The Decision
One feature Jake loved was the "dictionary containing all the recipes." This is a perfect metaphor for the AI tools we’ve discussed. Whether it’s an NFL scouting database or a coding assistant, these tools are "dictionaries"—they provide the building blocks. But as the course blog on Moral Agency argued, a dictionary can't make a judgment call. In the game, you have to decide which resource is most precious in a moment of crisis. In life, and in sports, we have to decide which risk is worth taking when the "dictionary" of stats says the odds are against us.
Jake mentiones that the story and writing in *Star Birds* were a bit basic, which is often the case in early-access resource games. This is where "human relevancy" comes in. We find meaning in the struggle to survive, even when the "script" isn't fully written yet. As noted in a Game Developer deep dive on randomness, it is the unpredictable elements—the "random" spawns and unexpected resource shortages—that keep players engaged. If a game (or a sport) is too predictable, we lose the drive to keep playing.
Final Thoughts: Beyond the Algorithm
As I wrap up my posts for February, Jake’s review reminds me that whether we are birds on an asteroid or athletes on a field, we are all looking for the same thing: a sense of purpose in a world of variables. AI can give us the dictionary, and simulations can show us the most likely asteroids to visit, but they cannot give us the courage to explore. My faith remains in the player, not the recipes. I’ll take the basic story and the beautiful randomness over a perfectly simulated, soulless victory any day.
