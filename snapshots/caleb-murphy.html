      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Caleb brings a financial markets lens to the network, examining how prediction platforms like Kalshi and Polymarket blur the line between gambling and day trading. His central insight: the same cognitive biases discussed in class—processing fluency, the illusion of understanding—apply directly to financial decision-making. Sports knowledge becomes tradeable when events are structured as binary contracts with order books rather than fixed odds. The series offers practical trading strategies while connecting back to class themes about managing information critically.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">The shift from sportsbook to prediction market isn't just about what you bet on—it's about the structure of the transaction. On Kalshi, you interact with an order book, not a house. Binary contracts (Yes/No, settling at $1 or $0) create price paths that can be traded intraday. The "price is the probability"—if a contract trades at $0.35, the market says 35% chance. This transforms emotional sports fandom into capital-turnover strategy.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">Fluency Illusion in Trading</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Drawing on Dr. Plate's concept, Caleb argues that processing fluency affects trading decisions: an authoritative-sounding tweet might be wrong, but because it's easy to read, we trade on it. Profitable trading requires "disfluent" thinking—slowing down to verify data before clicking 'buy.' If your "digital plate" is cluttered with emotional social media takes, your trading will be reactive rather than systematic.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">Information as Asset</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">In prediction markets, the "asset" being traded is information. The moment news breaks—an injury, a coaching change—the "fair value" changes instantly, but market price takes time to adjust. Profitability isn't about sports expertise; it's about having the fastest information feed and lowest latency in execution. "News lag" scalping exploits the 15-45 second gap between event and price adjustment.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 21, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Part 2 of the prediction market series. Moves from theory to practice: arbitrage between Kalshi (CFTC-regulated) and Polymarket (decentralized, crypto-based) exploits price discrepancies between user bases. "News lag" scalping profits from the 15-45 second gap between event and price adjustment. "Free riding" strategy: sell enough contracts mid-event to recover initial investment, letting remaining position ride risk-free. Connects trading discipline to Dr. Plate's "digital plate composition" concept—a cluttered information environment produces reactive, fluency-driven decisions.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 21, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Part 1 of a series on the financialization of everything. Explains how Kalshi transforms traditional sports betting (static wagers against the house) into day trading (order books, intraday liquidity, position management). Binary contracts settle at $1 (true) or $0 (false); the price IS the probability. CFTC regulation as "event contracts" rather than state gaming commission oversight allows nationwide access. The experience shifts from emotional gambling to high-frequency capital turnover.</p>
