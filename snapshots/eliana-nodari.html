        <p>Eliana tackles the AI conversation with rigorous research and comparative analysis, drawing on academic studies, policy analysis, and close engagement with primary sources like Ted Chiang's Princeton lecture and Steve Yegge's "vibe coding" concept. Her writing systematically dismantles viral claims about AI's environmental impact while engaging seriously with educational critiques. Central thesis: thinking has <em>relocated</em> rather than disappeared—from sentence-level execution to higher-order judgment, evaluation, and architectural oversight.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">AI environmental claims are "mathematically illiterate" when compared to legacy industries. The textile industry accounts for 20% of global wastewater; traditional banking consumes ~263 TWh/year; gold mining uses 131 TWh. A single ChatGPT query uses ~2 milliliters of water; one pair of jeans requires 7,500 liters. AI data centers are increasingly powered by renewables and can be tools for environmental remediation (smart grids, precision farming, climate modeling).</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engaging Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge: Chiang locates thinking at the sentence level; Yegge describes "vibe coding" where experts orchestrate systems through natural language. Eliana argues thinking has relocated—from "How do I implement this function?" to "Is this the right approach?" The expertise Chiang values still exists, but expressed through "the right questions" rather than "the right semicolons."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Banning AI doesn't protect students—it traps them in mechanical labor rather than pushing them toward "higher-order thinking governance." Students who graduate from AI-free environments lack information management skills needed in 2026 workforce. Key skills gained through integration: norming/metacognition (articulating what you want clearly), calibration (comparing your analysis to AI's), information management at scale.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engages fairly with the counterargument: frequent AI reliance can cause "overconfidence without competence" if students never develop pattern recognition from manual work. The "architect" level may be inaccessible to those who never served as "bricklayers." Solution: education must be redefined as "Judgment Training"—students spend their hours on interrogation of text, not production of it.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">"The expertise described by Yegge—the 2,000 hours of learning to predict and redirect—suggests that the intellectual capabilities Chiang values are still present, but they are now expressed through the 'right questions' rather than the right semicolons."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responds to Dr. Plate's "The Ocean in the Chatbot." Recontextualizes AI's environmental footprint against global industrial data. Compares textile industry (20% of global wastewater), banking (263 TWh/year), gold mining (131 TWh) against AI data centers. Argues the "viral truth" of a "thirsty chatbot" prioritizes engagement over accuracy. Pivots to showing AI as environmental solution: DeepMind reduced Google data center cooling by 40%; precision farming reduces water waste; satellite imagery tracks deforestation.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engages Ted Chiang's "forklift in the weight room" metaphor alongside Steve Yegge's "vibe coding." Uses MIT Media Lab's "Your Brain on ChatGPT" study on cognitive debt—AI reduces extraneous load (formatting, boilerplate) allowing accumulation of germane load (building complex mental models). Acknowledges the risk: Microsoft Research survey found AI reliance reduces "perceived effort of critical thinking," causing "overconfidence without competence." The challenge is ensuring students become "directors" not "passive conduits."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Analysis of Dr. Plate's "What a Ban Can't Teach." Examines the paradox: banning tools removes necessity of judgment, yet we expect students to master complex rhetorical skills. Details what integration teaches: norming (developing own rubrics), calibration (comparing analysis to AI's), information management at 66-posts-per-week scale. Argues "network accountability" (22 peers reading your work) guards against generic AI output better than prohibition. The danger isn't AI-generated text but AI-governed thinking.</p>
