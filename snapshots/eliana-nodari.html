      <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>
      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Eliana tackles the AI conversation with rigorous research and comparative analysis, drawing on academic studies, policy analysis, and close engagement with primary sources like Ted Chiang's Princeton lecture, Steve Yegge's "vibe coding" concept, and Walter Benjamin's theory of artistic "aura." Her writing systematically dismantles viral claims about AI's environmental impact while engaging seriously with educational critiques. Central thesis: thinking has <em>relocated</em> rather than disappeared -- from sentence-level execution to higher-order judgment, evaluation, and architectural oversight. Her recent work extends into the creative arts and digital addiction, arguing that both social media and AI threaten the "deep work" of creativity, and that art without human struggle is "slop" -- a hollow imitation that satisfies the senses but fails to nourish the soul.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responding to Jonas Rodrigues's critique of AI-generated music, Eliana draws on Walter Benjamin's concept of artistic "aura" to argue that AI lacks intent and therefore lacks authenticity. When tools remove the resistance of creation, the result becomes less human. AI-generated art is "slop" -- it satisfies senses but fails to nourish the soul. However, AI used as a "digital apprentice" for technical tasks (noise reduction, color grading) can free artists for high-level conceptual work. The danger arises only when the tool dictates the direction of the work.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extending Sam Levine's social media vs. AI addiction framework, Eliana identifies two distinct threats: the "loud" addiction of social media (intermittent variable rewards, infinite scroll) and the "quiet" addiction of AI (outsourcing thinking, becoming "prompt engineers" for our own lives). Together they create a "cognitive bypass" where the human mind becomes a coordinator of digital inputs rather than a generator of original value. Drawing on Cal Newport's "Deep Work" and Adam Alter's "Irresistible," she proposes the "Socratic AI Method" -- using AI to interrogate arguments rather than produce answers.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engaging Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge: Chiang locates thinking at the sentence level; Yegge describes "vibe coding" where experts orchestrate systems through natural language. Eliana argues thinking has relocated -- from "How do I implement this function?" to "Is this the right approach?" The expertise Chiang values still exists, but expressed through "the right questions" rather than "the right semicolons."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Art's true worth lies in incommensurable qualities: challenging perception, fostering empathy, recording the <em>feeling</em> of history. AI-generated art is "hollow" -- a statistical arrangement lacking emotional intentionality. Because there is no "self" behind the machine, there is no true communication. Art is a "social contract between two conscious minds"; replacing artists with AI is the ultimate "hyper-commodification."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas Rodrigues's "Cognitive Atrophy." Draws on Walter Benjamin's concept of artistic "aura" and Jaron Lanier's "You Are Not a Gadget" to argue that AI-generated art lacks intent and therefore authenticity. Gamification of music shifts value from the artifact to the act of generation -- the "user" feels a rush of creation but has risked nothing and communicated nothing. AI threatens live performance by retraining audiences for instant gratification. But AI as "digital apprentice" for technical tasks can free artists for conceptual work. "To protect the future of creativity, we must resist the urge to turn art into a slot machine."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extends Sam Levine's social media vs. AI addiction argument. Identifies the "loud" addiction (social media's intermittent variable rewards, per Adam Alter's "Irresistible") and the "quiet" addiction (AI as a drug of convenience, per Jaron Lanier). Cal Newport's "Deep Work" frames the stakes: the ability to focus without distraction is becoming a "superpower." Proposes three countermeasures: Analog First (never start a project with a prompt), Engineering "Stopping Cues" (app timers, phone-free zones), and the Socratic AI Method (ask AI to critique your argument, not write it).</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Introduces the "pulse" concept -- the underlying intent, scars of lived experience, and soul that remains fundamentally human. Draws on Margaret Boden's creativity taxonomy: AI excels at combinational and exploratory creativity but struggles with transformational creativity requiring deep understanding of value and context. Productive integration means using AI as "sparring partner" for brainstorming and research while humans remain the architects. "Let us embrace the machine's rhythm, but never forget that the music belongs to us."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Examines the paradox of possessing tools that generate "masterpieces" in seconds while we protect the human spark that takes a lifetime to refine. Human creativity is an act of translation -- AI cannot replicate it because AI doesn't "experience" the world. LLMs function through stochastic parity: mirrors, not windows. But AI can be a "brainstorming partner" helping overcome the blank page. The individual must remain the primary driver of narrative, emotion, and final decision-making.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Isabella Calmet's "The Tomorrow Code." Extends the bioethics conversation: while genome editing can eradicate congenital disorders, framing certain traits as defects to "fix" risks devaluing people currently living with those conditions. Cites the disability rights "Social Model" -- people are disabled more by societal barriers than impairments. Also raises the "Genetic Gap": if CRISPR remains expensive, we move from social classes to "biological castes."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jeffrey Way's "I'm Done." Connects Way's professional pivot to pedagogical arguments. The 40% staff reduction validates the urgency of AI integration in education. The shift from "creator" to "orchestrator" mirrors the shift from memorization to critical analysis. "Vibe coding" only works if the human has deep-domain expertise to catch "visual debt" in AI output. The skill of the 2030s will be "discernment."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extends Dominic Debro's "Dopamine Ceiling" through Dr. Anna Lembke's "Dopamine Nation." Constant overstimulation causes downregulation of dopamine receptors, leading to "digital anhedonia" where the physical world feels muted. This has devastating effects on our relationship with art -- historically requiring a "slow gaze," art cannot compete with engineered digital intensity.</p>
