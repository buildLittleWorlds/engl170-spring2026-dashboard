      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Jaden's writing has expanded well beyond his initial AI-in-education argument into a wide-ranging series on the business of AI, creative rights, and entertainment. On the business side, he examines OpenAI's financial crisis ($16B projected loss in 2026) and the structural dilemma of a company caught between subscription revenue and advertising. On AI art, he takes a contrarian position: the fears are overblown, just as fears of the DAW disrupting live music were overblown. And his Star Birds game review adds a distinctly personal voice -- a student who loves games, pays attention to craft, and gives an 8/10 while noting the weak story writing. Together, these posts suggest a writer finding his range: not just education policy but the full ecology of AI in culture and commerce.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responds to Dr. Plate's "Thinking at a Higher Level." While agreeing that asking questions is important, argues that learning through asking AI "lowers essential things such as critical thinking and problem solving." If students are taught to ask AI for things instead of make things, they risk being unprepared for situations where AI isn't available.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Draws on COVID virtual learning experience: staying home seemed like a win until students realized they lacked the self-control not to disengage. Same dynamic applies to AI—"normalizing the use of AI and hoping students only use it as a help instead of making it do the full assignment is dangerous and inconsistent at best." Studies show 25% of students admit to using AI to cheat (likely a floor, not ceiling).</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">A full game review of Kurzgesagt's Star Birds — a tycoon/survival hybrid that asks players to build a self-sustaining civilization. Praises the beautiful art style (true to Kurzgesagt's signature aesthetic), the exploration and crafting loop, and especially the recipe dictionary with its search bar ("genuinely useful"). Critiques the weak story writing and underdeveloped character voices. Final verdict: 8/10. The review signals Jaden's comfort applying evaluative criteria carefully — noting both what works and what doesn't without defaulting to generality.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 2, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Takes a contrarian position in the AI art debate: the fears are overblown. Uses the DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) analogy — when digital music production democratized, critics predicted it would destroy professional musicians, but companies still prefer live symphonies for prestige and authenticity. AI art will follow the same pattern. Addresses copyright fears directly: they're solvable with new legislation; AI output isn't easily copyrighted; the cost argument against AI taking over ignores human demand for authenticity. Jaden's position: worry about the problems we actually have, not the ones we imagine.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Examines OpenAI's financial crisis: $16B projected loss in 2026, revenue models that don't cover compute costs, and the structural dilemma between subscription fees (which users resist at scale) and advertising (which threatens the user trust that makes the product valuable). Also covers Elon Musk's $134B lawsuit. Jaden's tone is analytical rather than alarmist — this is a standard business problem of a company that grew faster than its revenue model. Future options: enterprise licensing, API pricing restructure, or acquisition.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Dr. Plate's "Thinking at a Higher Level." While agreeing AI isn't inherently bad and generative-art criticisms are overblown, argues the "higher-level thinking" framing ignores real problems. Teaching students to ask questions lowers critical thinking skills; students lack self-control to use AI responsibly (25% admit to cheating); COVID virtual learning shows what happens when students are expected to self-regulate. Proposes balance leaning toward independence—teach kids to use AI "to think instead of using it to tell."</p>
