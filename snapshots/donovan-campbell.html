        <p>Donovan engages with the network's debates on AI and labor from an optimistic but thoughtful angle. His central position: AI represents a fundamental shift in how we work, but the narrative of "robot replacement" misses the real story. AI doesn't eliminate human purpose—it changes where human value is applied. In sports, he argues AI safety technology is the "next great revolution" that protects athletes rather than diminishing competition. The "soul" of the game isn't in torn ligaments; it's in the human spirit that AI can preserve.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Isabella Calmet's "50/50 Rule." AI is becoming the most essential tool for preserving the human body in motion. Computer vision and wearable sensors can detect micro-adjustments—3% stride length decreases, subtle planting shifts—that signal impending injury before athletes feel fatigued. The NFL's Digital Athlete creates personalized recovery protocols based on HRV, sleep, and blood markers. Critics worry about losing "grit," but "the soul of the game is the athlete"—there is nothing heroic about preventable injuries or CTE.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Automation Anxiety</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Challenges the "robot replacement" narrative with the "Lump of Labor" fallacy: there isn't a fixed amount of work in the world. When computers were invented, new industries like software engineering and digital marketing emerged. However, the speed of AI transition—months rather than decades—creates a "skills gap" where people are displaced faster than they can retrain. The solution isn't competing with AI on speed, but leaning into complex ethical reasoning, genuine social connection, and the creation of truly new ideas.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Isabella Calmet's "50/50 Rule." Argues we're moving from "reactive" to "predictive" sports medicine. AI makes the invisible visible—detecting biomechanical failures before catastrophic injuries occur. Concussion protocols become data-driven: helmets with sensors measuring G-force and brain impact by angle. The "N-of-1" model creates personalized recovery protocols. Key insight: as AI becomes cheaper, the "Guardian in the Machine" will extend from elite franchises to high school coaches—reducing life-altering injuries in youth sports. "By embracing AI, we aren't making sports less competitive—we are making them more sustainable."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 21, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Examines the debate between "techno-optimists" (AI automates boring tasks) and "doomers" (permanent underclass of obsolete workers). Goldman Sachs projects generative AI could automate 300 million full-time job equivalents. But the "Lump of Labor" fallacy shows new industries emerge as old ones transform. The real concern: the speed of transition creates skills gaps faster than retraining. In ENGL 170's focus on "intellectual work," the answer is leaning into what AI struggles with—genuine innovation, deep empathy, original philosophical argument. The policy question: if AI captures productivity gains, should society benefit through shorter work weeks or UBI?</p>
