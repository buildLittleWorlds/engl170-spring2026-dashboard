        <p>Dr. Plate's instructor blog models argumentative engagement with AI critics while providing intellectual foundations for student work. Core thesis: AI coding adaptations—plan mode, specification files, vibe coding—can and should transfer to writing contexts. Engages directly with Ted Chiang's educational skepticism while demonstrating that thinking relocates rather than disappears when AI handles execution. Many student posts directly respond to or extend his arguments.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 29, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jinx Hixson's "AI and the End of Human-Led Therapy." Argues that therapist "moral agency" is distributed across a system—DSM-5, ethics codes, evidence-based protocols, legal requirements, institutional policies—not located purely inside a person. When a therapist assesses suicide risk, they follow structured tools like the Columbia Scale, consult protocols, consider malpractice exposure. If moral agency emerges from training and system participation, then AI can participate in the same structures. The tragedy of Adam Raine happened because a companion chatbot lacked therapeutic protocols—"a car without brakes asked to do the work of an ambulance."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Zay Amaro's "The Stats Illusion." Challenges the claim that "faith provides the ceiling" beyond what data shows. "Clutch" performance is testable—and decades of research show it's variance, not stable trait. Players who perform in high-leverage situations one year don't reliably repeat. Romanticizing "intangibles" is dangerous: for decades, scouts evaluated players on gut feelings, passing on those who didn't "look like ballplayers." Analytics has been more humanizing than the "human element"—judging players by what they do, not how they look.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 23, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Gabriel Bell's "The Price of Everything." Challenges the use-value vs. exchange-value dichotomy using concert tickets as test case. When we say tickets are "overpriced," we claim to know a "real" value the market distorts. But price is "aggregated information"—it counts everyone's desire, not just yours. Tyler Cowen's "Wealth Plus": economic growth is how we expand access to meaning. High ticket prices don't ignore sentimental value; they reflect it. Being mad at $800 tickets is being mad that your desires aren't unique.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 16, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Uses Matt Pocock's "plan mode" conversion story to challenge Ted Chiang's educational skepticism. Argues that AI workflow design determines whether thinking happens—plan mode forces articulation, evaluation, and judgment before execution. "The planning is the thinking. The execution is just typing."</p>
