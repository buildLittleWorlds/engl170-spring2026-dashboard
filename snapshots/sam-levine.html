        <p>Sam explores AI across multiple domains—writing tools, ocean research, sports officiating, and AI safety—while carefully engaging with classmates' arguments. Her most developed work refines Eliana Nodari's forklift metaphor, drawing on Ethan Mollick's "Co-Intelligence" to distinguish harmful from helpful AI use. Central insight: AI becomes harmful when it replaces thinking students could perform, but valuable when it supports learners still building foundational skills. Intent determines whether it's shortcut or scaffold.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Many students turn to AI not to avoid effort, but because they're uncertain or lack foundational knowledge to begin. In these situations, AI functions as a guide—prompting questions, clarifying confusion, supporting skill development. The key distinction: AI is harmful when it replaces thinking you could do; it's helpful when it supports thinking you're still learning.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Eliana Nodari explores Ted Chiang's "forklift in the weight room" metaphor with concern about bypassing effort. Sam refines it using Ethan Mollick: using a forklift to lift for someone entirely prevents growth, but using it to teach proper form, demonstrate technique, or safely engage with weights before strength develops can foster understanding. Intent is key.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Gen Z's media environment is characterized by rapid consumption and instant answers. AI can either reinforce passive consumption or encourage active learning. When students use AI to ask questions, test ideas, and explore unfamiliar material, it cultivates curiosity. The cognitive work shifts from mechanical drafting to strategic problem-solving.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 2, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Applies AI-as-partner framework to rugby tackling and injury prevention, engaging Trinity College Dublin's AI research on tackle technique analysis. AI can identify dangerous patterns in high-speed footage that coaches miss, potentially making the sport safer without removing human agency. Key insight: autonomy doesn't require acting without support—rugby has always used teammates, coaches, trainers, and film review. AI is just another tool athletes can choose to use. "The future of rugby is not humans competing against machines. It is humans learning how to work alongside them."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 1, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Dominic Debro's surveillance concerns. Directly challenges the claim that AI reduces effort or replaces human drive. From her perspective as an athlete, AI is a tool—one of many. Structured, data-driven training has always been part of sports. Athletic trainers (ATs) combine AI data with knowledge of athlete's body, mindset, and fatigue. "AI provides information, but humans interpret it and make the final call." The human element—discipline, judgment, resilience—remains central to success.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 29, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Zay Amaro's "Hacking the Limit." Pushes back strongly on the idea that injury is part of sport's "soul." Injuries aren't narrative magic—they're trauma, loss, and permanent damage. Protecting athletes through AI doesn't erase humanity; it preserves it. The unpredictability worth protecting is the unpredictability of competition, not injury. "The soul of sport has never been in torn ligaments. It has always been in human effort."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jeffrey Way's video. Draws on Ethan Mollick's "Co-Intelligence" to argue AI works best as a partner, not replacement. "The real promise of AI isn't automation—it's augmentation." Compares AI to training tools in athletics: coaches and technology support performance without replacing the athlete. Using AI well requires clarity, communication, and evaluation—humans remain responsible for judgment and decisions.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Zay Amaro's sports posts. Nuances the "human vs. AI" debate: Sam agrees that emotion, pressure, and intentionality cannot be quantified, but argues analytics isn't the enemy. Cites "Turning Data Into Wisdom" on analytics' limits—"intangible factors such as team dynamics, emotional resilience, and individual player motivations" resist quantification. The "25% chance" where probability fails is where human improvisation lives. Key insight: fans can choose whether to engage analytics; prediction increases pressure rather than removing it. Proposes partnership rather than replacement.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas Rodrigues's "AI Balancing Act." Explores the tension between AI as tool vs. crutch—when does "help" become "replacement"? Sam reflects on her own workflow: reaching for AI before brainstorming, letting outlines arrive pre-formed. Draws on Sherry Turkle ("We expect more from technology and less from each other") to argue the real risk is reduced tolerance for struggle. The word at stake: autonomy—not just making choices, but developing ideas independently.</p>
