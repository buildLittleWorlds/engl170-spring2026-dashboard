      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Jacob writes from a pragmatic, systems-level perspective, examining how AI disrupts existing power structures and skill hierarchies. His central thesis: resistance to AI often masks deeper fears about professional obsolescence, and what critics call "easy" AI use is actually characterized by friction, correction, and adversarial management. He has expanded his scope to sports science, arguing AI isn't just preventing injuries—it's enabling biological regeneration through AI-designed peptides. The future isn't the "Digital Twin" (which models injury); it's "Generative Biology" (which fixes it).</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Jacob argues that framing AI use as a "personal preference" obscures a harsh reality: students who don't learn AI integration are being "actively left behind." The real danger isn't lost agency—it's creating "a class of professionals who are functionally illiterate in the primary language of the future economy."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Lazarus Protocol</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responds to Sam Levine's injury prevention focus. Prevention is "defense"—the real revolution is offense: Generative Biology. AI-designed peptides like BPC-157 send "super-signals" for tissue repair. Using AlphaFold 3, researchers design novel proteins that bind to specific tissue receptors with 100x the affinity of natural hormones. The destination is the "Regenerated Athlete"—the human who can break, rebuild, and return stronger than biology intended.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jeffrey Way's "I'm Done." Way has reached "the acceptance stage of grief regarding generative AI." But "vibe coding" (blindly trusting AI output) is dangerous—the future belongs to those with deep domain knowledge who can audit machine output. We face a "great bifurcation": those who wield AI as exoskeletons vs. those who refuse out of nostalgia or fear. "The war against the machine is over. The war for relevance has just begun."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Directly challenges Jinx's "Fluency Illusion" argument: "If your AI workflow feels 'fluent' and 'easy,' you are doing it wrong." Professional AI use involves constant friction—spotting flaws requires deep subject knowledge, formulating corrections requires logic, and re-prompting requires rhetorical precision. This is "management, not helplessness."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jinx Hixson's "AI and the End of Human-Led Therapy." Challenges the "human-led only" model as a logistics failure—85% of people with mental health issues receive no treatment because human therapists are a bottleneck. AI is the "democratization of the mind"—24/7 availability, fraction of cost, zero waitlist. Proposes a "Hybrid Protocol": AI handles high-volume data-driven optimization (tracking mood, offering CBT at 3 AM) while humans focus on high-stakes crisis intervention. "Efficiency is not the enemy of empathy."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Sam Levine's injury prevention post. Prevention is a low bar—"defense." The real revolution is "Generative Biology": AI-designed peptides that fix the body rather than just model injuries. BPC-157 is primitive compared to what's coming: AI-designed proteins that "hyper-signal" tissue repair at maximum theoretical capacity. If AI can optimize code and logistics, it can optimize cellular repair. "The Quantified Athlete is just the first step. The destination is the Regenerated Athlete."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jeffrey Way's "I'm Done" video. Way's confession that AI devastated his educational business while making programming more fun captures automation's dual nature: painful displacement AND radical efficiency. Way has reached "the acceptance stage of grief." Argues against "vibe coding" (blindly trusting AI)—the future belongs to those with deep domain knowledge who can audit.

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Sam Levine's sports AI post. The real revolution isn't AI calling plays—it's AI reconstructing the athlete. The NFL's "Digital Athlete" program creates virtual replicas predicting injuries before they happen. AI-designed peptides like BPC-157 send "super-signals" for targeted tissue repair. Training shifts from brute repetition to managing a data stream of stimulus and response. Athletes will be cyborgs not with robotic arms but with AI managing recovery.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jinx Hixson's "Digital Age Compulsions." Reframes the narrative: while one type of AI hijacks dopamine loops, another is revolutionizing drug discovery. AlphaFold 3 designs peptides like GLP-1 agonists that silence "food noise" and other compulsions. "We're entering an era where silicon intelligence repairs carbon intelligence." For millions who can't "step away" due to biological chemistry, AI isn't the trap—it's the key that fixes the hardware.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jinx Hixson's "Fluency Illusion" post. Argues that professional AI interaction involves constant friction: AI misses nuance, hallucinates connections, devolves into caricature. Correcting these errors requires subject expertise, logic, and rhetorical precision. The new "desirable difficulty" is evaluating three plausible-sounding arguments. Proposes teaching "distrust as a skill."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Dr. Plate's "The Book and the Chatbot." If environmental objections are so easily debunked by a spreadsheet, why do they persist? They're a "Green Mask"—moral licensing that transforms fear of change into virtue. The academic world has "sunk costs" in atoms (libraries, lecture halls). We treat textbook water as "good water" and prompt water as "bad water" based on which system we control.</p>

Details the sophisticated AI workflow: prompt engineering requiring precision, verification requiring expertise, integration requiring judgment. This shifts work "up the value chain"—less time on syntax, more time on argument architecture.</p>
