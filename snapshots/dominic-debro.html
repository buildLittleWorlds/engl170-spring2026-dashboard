      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Dominic takes a philosophical, theory-driven approach to AI, drawing on cognitive science frameworks like Cognitive Load Theory, the Extended Mind thesis, and neuroscience of attention. His central argument: not all struggle is equally valuable, and AI should free us to focus on what actually matters—high-level judgment, architecture of ideas, and "intent" rather than execution. He frames the shift as moving from "Constructor" to "Architect of Intent," while also grappling seriously with surveillance capitalism, post-scarcity economics, and the "employment trap" of valuing jobs over purpose.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Efficiency Paradox</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responding to Gabriel Bell's defense of struggle, Dominic distinguishes "constructive struggle" (grappling with ethical dilemmas) from "empty labor" (formatting bibliographies, summarizing to find one fact). When we insist on doing everything the "expensive" way, "we aren't getting smarter; we are just getting tired." If we spend all energy on "atoms" of tasks, nothing remains for "architecture" of solutions.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">From Constructor to Architect</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engaging Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge debate. Chiang sees sentence-level struggle as cognitive training; Yegge describes "vibe coding" where experts orchestrate rather than type. Dominic argues thinking hasn't disappeared—it has relocated from "how" to "what." The "Friction Fallacy" mistakes technical hurdles for conceptual ones. AI's gift is eliminating "cognitive noise" (syntax, formatting) so thinkers can stay in flow, focused on intent.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Sentinel in the Locker Room</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extending Zay's "Safety Algorithm" analysis, Dominic connects sports surveillance to Foucault's Panopticon and Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism. The "cognitive comfort" of clean data charts hides a deeper threat: we're trading autonomy for false security. When employee keystrokes and biometric stress are monitored for "wellness," safety becomes a pretext for 24/7 surveillance. Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction"—opaque algorithms that ruin lives through proxy variables—exemplify this danger.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Employment Trap</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Drawing on David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs," Dominic argues we've become so obsessed with "full employment" that we've stopped asking if work is actually worth doing. The fear of job loss is really fear of poverty, not fear of leisure. If survival was decoupled from labor (through UBI), humans could focus on community building, arts, care work. The real challenge isn't "saving" jobs AI can do better—it's redesigning society so "when machines take the work, people get the benefits."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas on the "site foreman" role. While Jonas emphasizes current necessity of human auditing, Dominic looks to the horizon: AI will eventually stop needing our "clean-up." In this "Black Box" era, our role shifts from protecting the codebase to protecting the purpose. AI is simply the next abstraction layer (like Java abstracting away memory management). We move from "Technicians of Logic" to "Architects of Experience"—defining the "Good" outcome rather than correcting junk.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Zay Amaro's "Safety Algorithm" post. Extends the NFL surveillance critique to corporate "wellness" monitoring, predictive policing, and algorithmic credit scoring. Uses Foucault's Panopticon, Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism, and Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" to argue we're trading autonomy for false security. When AI decides you're a "risk" based on proxy variables, it "benches you from society." The "Death of Grit"—when algorithms tell us we're too stressed to try—creates a zero-risk society at highest risk of losing its resilience.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas Rodrigues's "site foreman" concept. While Jonas emphasizes current need for human auditing, Dominic looks ahead to the "Black Box" era where AI architects without human verification. Rather than threat, this is "ultimate liberation of intent." AI is simply the next abstraction layer (Assembly → Java → AI). The shift to "Curatorial Excellence" means human expertise moves toward ethics, strategy, and systemic impact. Cites Anthropic's research on the "collaboration paradox" and WEF's "Supercharged Progress" scenario.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 1, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Challenges the "job creation" obsession using David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs" theory. Politicians are hailed for creating jobs even if those roles are pointless or harmful. AI displacement (WEF projects 92 million jobs by 2030) isn't failure—it's advancement: liberation of human time. Brynjolfsson and McAfee's "Great Decoupling" shows productivity rises while employment stagnates. If we decoupled survival from labor (UBI), the "less jobs" future could be a golden age focused on community, arts, and care.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Dr. Plate's post on prices and scarcity. Imagines AI as a "signal jammer" that changes the rules of value. If AI automates "effort," the "Effort Gap" that justifies wage inequality starts to close. Draws on Daniel Susskind's "task encroachment" and Jeremy Rifkin's "Zero Marginal Cost Society." Proposes "Post-Scarcity" communal model but wrestles honestly with three counterarguments: the "Steering Skill Floor" (prompt literacy as new elite skill), the "Physical Bottleneck" (AI can't generate more Earth), and the "Incentive Problem."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Direct response to Jinx Hixson's OCD post, offering practical antidotes to the "Dopamine Ceiling." Uses Andrew Huberman's neuroscience: dopamine "stacking" creates peaks followed by crashes. Proposes two-pronged approach: eliminate the "loud" (grayscale phone, 20-minute rule, single-tasking) and embrace the "quiet" (tactile grounding, window gazing, analog media, box breathing). Frames boredom as rehabilitation for overstimulated minds.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 18, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Direct response to Gabriel Bell's "The Cost of Human Relevancy." Challenges the premise that struggle itself creates value. Uses Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller): overloading working memory with "extraneous" tasks inhibits "germane" learning. AI removes extraneous load so brain can focus on high-level mental models. Uses Extended Mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers) to argue AI extends rather than replaces thought.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extends Jinx Hixson's "Exaggeration Effect" analysis through neuroscience lens. Introduces the "Dopamine Ceiling" concept: constant hyper-stimulation causes hedonic adaptation where baseline excitement rises until normal life feels grey. Draws on Dr. Anna Lembke's "Dopamine Nation" and pleasure-pain balance model. Solution: metacognitive awareness and intentionally practicing boredom to reset the pleasure-pain balance.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 15, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Frames Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge as debate over where thinking happens. Identifies the "Friction Fallacy": belief that because writing is hard, hardness is the source of value. Distinguishes cognitive noise from conceptual work. AI eliminates noise so thinkers stay in flow. But this requires "hyper-presence"—because AI moves fast and can hallucinate, operators must maintain "total intellectual vigilance." The Apprenticeship Paradox: experts can "vibe code" because they built intuition through years of manual work.</p>
