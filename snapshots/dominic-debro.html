      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Dominic takes a philosophical, theory-driven approach to AI, drawing on cognitive science frameworks like Cognitive Load Theory, the Extended Mind thesis, and neuroscience of attention. His central argument: not all struggle is equally valuable, and AI should free us to focus on what actually matters—high-level judgment, architecture of ideas, and "intent" rather than execution. He frames the shift as moving from "Constructor" to "Architect of Intent," while also grappling seriously with surveillance capitalism, post-scarcity economics, and the "employment trap" of valuing jobs over purpose. His most recent posts have pivoted toward culture: as a musician, he documents the global "Aesthetic Revolt" against AI-generated sterility—the "Sweat Economy," the "New Sincerity" movement (Mk.gee, Dijon, Geese), and the death of monoculture in the age of algorithmic personalization. This cultural trilogy builds on his earlier techno-optimism with a more ambivalent reckoning: AI may have set the floor for "good," but it has simultaneously destroyed the shared witnessing that makes culture meaningful.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Efficiency Paradox</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responding to Gabriel Bell's defense of struggle, Dominic distinguishes "constructive struggle" (grappling with ethical dilemmas) from "empty labor" (formatting bibliographies, summarizing to find one fact). When we insist on doing everything the "expensive" way, "we aren't getting smarter; we are just getting tired." If we spend all energy on "atoms" of tasks, nothing remains for "architecture" of solutions.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engaging Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge debate. Chiang sees sentence-level struggle as cognitive training; Yegge describes "vibe coding" where experts orchestrate rather than type. Dominic argues thinking hasn't disappeared—it has relocated from "how" to "what." The "Friction Fallacy" mistakes technical hurdles for conceptual ones. AI's gift is eliminating "cognitive noise" (syntax, formatting) so thinkers can stay in flow, focused on intent.</p>
        </div>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extending Zay's "Safety Algorithm" analysis, Dominic connects sports surveillance to Foucault's Panopticon and Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism. The "cognitive comfort" of clean data charts hides a deeper threat: we're trading autonomy for false security. When employee keystrokes and biometric stress are monitored for "wellness," safety becomes a pretext for 24/7 surveillance. Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction"—opaque algorithms that ruin lives through proxy variables—exemplify this danger.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Employment Trap</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Drawing on David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs," Dominic argues we've become so obsessed with "full employment" that we've stopped asking if work is actually worth doing. The fear of job loss is really fear of poverty, not fear of leisure. If survival was decoupled from labor (through UBI), humans could focus on community building, arts, care work. The real challenge isn't "saving" jobs AI can do better—it's redesigning society so "when machines take the work, people get the benefits."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas on the "site foreman" role. While Jonas emphasizes current necessity of human auditing, Dominic looks to the horizon: AI will eventually stop needing our "clean-up." In this "Black Box" era, our role shifts from protecting the codebase to protecting the purpose. AI is simply the next abstraction layer (like Java abstracting away memory management). We move from "Technicians of Logic" to "Architects of Experience"—defining the "Good" outcome rather than correcting junk.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 15, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responds to Jonas's "Slot-Machine Symphony" on a macro-cultural level: the death of the shared "Watercooler Moment." AI-driven algorithms have moved us into separate rooms—you can have a song with 100 million streams that 90% of people have never heard. The "48-Hour Lifecycle" of viral content replaces the "season" a great record once had. The "Discovery Phase" is gone: AI curation gives us only what it already knows we like. Proposes resistance through physical presence (small-room residencies, live-only tracks) and "Analog Intention"—the act of staying with a record or piece of hardware for a while, saying "I am here." "If it isn't an event we can share, it's just noise."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">February 12, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Documents the counter-movement to algorithmic perfectionism: artists like Mk.gee and Dijon who lean into being "cringe," "ugly," and "too much." AI generates statistical averages—the "most probable next note." New Sincerity artists do the opposite. Mk.gee's brittle, wobbling guitar tone is "un-optimizable." Geese's live sets sound like a manic episode. Argues that "sincerity is a radical act"—to be too weird and specific is to make yourself unscrape-able. Introduces "Site-Specific Sound" (recording in rooms with bad acoustics as a thumbprint) and "Micro-Dynamics" (the tiny volume shifts that AI-maximized tracks flatten out). Concludes: "The future of music isn't about being better than the machine; it's about being more human than the machine."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Personal account from inside the music scene: Dominic documents the "Aesthetic Revolt" he's witnessing firsthand in small venues and late-night studio sessions. Data points: a January 2026 Epidemic Sound report showing a 40% spike in audiences seeking "un-quantized" live performances; an AdAge report finding Gen Z and Alpha consumers 70% more likely to engage with "unfiltered" content. Introduces the "Sweat Economy"—fans voting with their wallets for physical effort and "the shambolic standard" (Pitchfork: the "Human Swing" of rhythmic drift is now more desirable than a perfect digital clock). Proposes the "Inefficiency Mandate": in art, value is directly tied to human time invested. "In 2026, the most beautiful thing an artist can do is be imperfect."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas Rodrigues's "Slot-Machine Symphony." While Jonas warns of "cognitive atrophy" from gamified music, Dominic sees a "Great Re-valuation": as AI makes the generic infinitely abundant, human-made art becomes luxury. Introduces "Proof of Human Work"&mdash;imperfections as certificates of authenticity. Case study: Brooklyn band Geese, whose frontman is "horny for mistakes." The "Slow Listening" and "Organic Sound" movements show audiences craving physicality, unpredictability, and shared witnessing. "The machine has set the floor for what is 'good,' but it has raised the ceiling for what is 'profound.'"</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Traces Brynjolfsson and McAfee's "Great Decoupling"&mdash;since the late 1970s, productivity has soared while wages flatlined. AI displacement isn't failure but advancement: the fear of AI is really fear of the economic system it enters. If we decouple survival from labor through UBI, we shift from "earning a living" to "living a life." Introduces "Time-Wealth" as the true measure of success: how much of a citizen's life belongs to them. "The machines are ready to take the work; it's time for us to take the benefits."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Zay Amaro's "Safety Algorithm" post. Extends the NFL surveillance critique to corporate "wellness" monitoring, predictive policing, and algorithmic credit scoring. Uses Foucault's Panopticon, Zuboff's Surveillance Capitalism, and Cathy O'Neil's "Weapons of Math Destruction" to argue we're trading autonomy for false security. When AI decides you're a "risk" based on proxy variables, it "benches you from society." The "Death of Grit"—when algorithms tell us we're too stressed to try—creates a zero-risk society at highest risk of losing its resilience.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Response to Jonas Rodrigues's "site foreman" concept. While Jonas emphasizes current need for human auditing, Dominic looks ahead to the "Black Box" era where AI architects without human verification. Rather than threat, this is "ultimate liberation of intent." AI is simply the next abstraction layer (Assembly → Java → AI). The shift to "Curatorial Excellence" means human expertise moves toward ethics, strategy, and systemic impact. Cites Anthropic's research on the "collaboration paradox" and WEF's "Supercharged Progress" scenario.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Challenges the "job creation" obsession using David Graeber's "Bullshit Jobs" theory. Politicians are hailed for creating jobs even if those roles are pointless or harmful. AI displacement (WEF projects 92 million jobs by 2030) isn't failure—it's advancement: liberation of human time. Brynjolfsson and McAfee's "Great Decoupling" shows productivity rises while employment stagnates. If we decoupled survival from labor (UBI), the "less jobs" future could be a golden age focused on community, arts, and care.</p>

If AI automates "effort," the "Effort Gap" that justifies wage inequality starts to close. Draws on Daniel Susskind's "task encroachment" and Jeremy Rifkin's "Zero Marginal Cost Society." Proposes "Post-Scarcity" communal model but wrestles honestly with three counterarguments: the "Steering Skill Floor" (prompt literacy as new elite skill), the "Physical Bottleneck" (AI can't generate more Earth), and the "Incentive Problem."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Direct response to Gabriel Bell's "The Cost of Human Relevancy." Challenges the premise that struggle itself creates value. Uses Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller): overloading working memory with "extraneous" tasks inhibits "germane" learning. AI removes extraneous load so brain can focus on high-level mental models.

Identifies the "Friction Fallacy": belief that because writing is hard, hardness is the source of value. Distinguishes cognitive noise from conceptual work. AI eliminates noise so thinkers stay in flow. But this requires "hyper-presence"—because AI moves fast and can hallucinate, operators must maintain "total intellectual vigilance." The Apprenticeship Paradox: experts can "vibe code" because they built intuition through years of manual work.</p>
