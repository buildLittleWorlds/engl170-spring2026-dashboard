        <p>Dominic takes a philosophical, theory-driven approach to AI, drawing on cognitive science frameworks like Cognitive Load Theory, the Extended Mind thesis, and neuroscience of attention. His central argument: not all struggle is equally valuable, and AI should free us to focus on what actually matters—high-level judgment, architecture of ideas, and "intent" rather than execution. He frames the shift as moving from "Constructor" to "Architect of Intent," where presence means engaging with the <em>what</em> rather than the <em>how</em>.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Efficiency Paradox</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Responding to Gabriel Bell's defense of struggle, Dominic distinguishes "constructive struggle" (grappling with ethical dilemmas) from "empty labor" (formatting bibliographies, summarizing to find one fact). When we insist on doing everything the "expensive" way, "we aren't getting smarter; we are just getting tired." If we spend all energy on "atoms" of tasks, nothing remains for "architecture" of solutions.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Extended Mind</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Drawing on Clark and Chalmers' philosophy, Dominic argues our minds don't stop at our skulls—we regularly delegate cognitive tasks to environment (notebooks, calculators). AI isn't "replacing" thoughts; it's extending them. Using AI to handle "noise" creates a more powerful cognitive loop where human provides intent, machine provides processing. Banning tools "forces the mind to work within a smaller, less capable boundary."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">From Constructor to Architect</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Engaging Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge debate. Chiang sees sentence-level struggle as cognitive training; Yegge describes "vibe coding" where experts orchestrate rather than type. Dominic argues thinking hasn't disappeared—it has relocated from "how" to "what." The "Friction Fallacy" mistakes technical hurdles for conceptual ones. AI's gift is eliminating "cognitive noise" (syntax, formatting) so thinkers can stay in flow, focused on intent.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Dopamine Ceiling</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extending Jinx's "Loud Lie Economy" analysis through neuroscience. Constant exposure to hyper-intense social media floods synapses with dopamine; brains compensate by lowering sensitivity (hedonic adaptation). Result: the "Dopamine Ceiling" where normal life no longer registers as stimulating. This causes "emotional atrophy"—our capacity for subtle emotion withers when we only respond to extreme stimuli.</p>

        <div class="snapshot-post">
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">"The thinking hasn't disappeared. It has transformed. Where a programmer once asked 'how do I implement this function?', they now ask 'is this the right approach?'"</p>
        </div>
        <div class="snapshot-post">
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">"By removing the 'stuff we don't want to do,' AI allows us to focus on the only thing that actually matters: the spark of human intent. It allows us to be present in the moment of creation without being distracted by the machinery of execution."</p>

        <div class="snapshot-post">
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">"True relevancy isn't found in how hard we work, but in the quality of what we produce and the depth of the problems we choose to solve."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 21, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Direct response to Jinx Hixson's OCD post, offering practical antidotes to the "Dopamine Ceiling." Uses Andrew Huberman's neuroscience: dopamine "stacking" creates peaks followed by crashes, lowering baseline pleasure. Proposes two-pronged approach: eliminate the "loud" (grayscale phone, 20-minute rule for compulsions, single-tasking) and embrace the "quiet" (tactile grounding, window gazing, analog media, box breathing). Warns against "ceiling lifters" like infinite scroll and AI reassurance-seeking. Frames boredom as rehabilitation for overstimulated minds.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 18, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Direct response to Gabriel Bell's "The Cost of Human Relevancy." Challenges the premise that struggle itself creates value. Uses Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller): the brain has limited working memory, and if overloaded with "extraneous" tasks (mechanical writing/summarizing), it inhibits "germane" learning—actual understanding. AI removes extraneous load so brain can focus on high-level mental models. Uses Extended Mind thesis (Clark & Chalmers) to argue AI extends rather than replaces thought.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 18, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Extends Jinx Hixson's "Exaggeration Effect" analysis through neuroscience lens. Introduces the "Dopamine Ceiling" concept: constant hyper-stimulation from social media floods reward system, causing hedonic adaptation where baseline excitement rises until normal life feels grey. Draws on Dr. Anna Lembke's "Dopamine Nation" and the pleasure-pain balance model. Solution: metacognitive awareness of algorithmic hijacking, choosing "slow media," intentionally practicing boredom to reset the pleasure-pain balance.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 15, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Frames Ted Chiang vs. Steve Yegge as debate over where thinking happens. Identifies the "Friction Fallacy": belief that because writing is hard, hardness is the source of value. Distinguishes cognitive noise (transitions, comma placement, boilerplate) from conceptual work. AI eliminates noise so thinkers stay in flow. But this requires "hyper-presence"—because AI moves fast and can hallucinate, operators must maintain "total intellectual vigilance." The Apprenticeship Paradox: experts can "vibe code" because they built intuition through years of manual work. Solution: redefine education as "Judgment Training."</p>
