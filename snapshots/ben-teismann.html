        <p>Ben began January making the case that AI threatens the emotional "soul" of automotive design and creates dangerous autonomy gaps in Tesla's marketing. By February, he had launched a sweeping six-part indictment that reframes the entire project: the problem with AI in cars is not just aesthetics&mdash;it is moral, structural, economic, racial, and civil libertarian. His nine posts form a comprehensive "Case Against the AI Car": AI's "Moral Black Box" evades accountability when vehicles kill; its technical fragility means the "last 1%" of edge cases remains catastrophically unsolved; its network connectivity transforms vehicles into remotely hackable weapons; its automation destroys 3.5 million trucking jobs and hollows out rural economies; its computer vision carries lethal racial bias against darker-skinned pedestrians; and its surveillance architecture converts the cabin into a biometric data farm. Where others debate whether AI makes cars better, Ben argues the AI car is a moral, safety, and social failure.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Moral Black Box</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">When AI kills, no one is responsible. The "Accountability Gap" diffuses blame across manufacturers, software providers, and sensor makers, all pointing to the "human in the loop" who had 0.2 seconds to intervene. Private corporations are writing public moral policy in opaque code, encoding "Trolley Problem" decisions without democratic accountability. "A society that allows machines to decide its casualties is a society that has lost its way."</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">Technical Fragility and the Sunk Cost of Autonomy</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">The AI car industry is trapped in a "Sunk Cost Fallacy." AI handles the easy 99% but fails catastrophically on edge cases&mdash;a rogue shopping cart, a traffic cop's hand signals, a blizzard. These aren't teething problems; they are structural limitations. The resulting complexity makes cars more expensive and less repairable: a fender bender now costs $10,000 because every smart bumper must be precisely calibrated. "The AI experiment in our cars has failed."</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Any connected system is a hackable system. Modern AI vehicles contain 100+ million lines of code with "adversarial attack" vulnerabilities&mdash;specific stickers can trick AI into misreading a stop sign as a speed limit sign. Over-the-Air update systems mean a single zero-day exploit could theoretically push malicious code to millions of vehicles simultaneously. "The open road is just one hack away from a catastrophe." Ben calls for "air-gapped" safety systems where critical driving functions are physically separated from internet connectivity.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">3.5 million professional truck drivers face elimination. Trucking is one of the few remaining career paths offering family-sustaining wages without a four-year degree&mdash;AI automation targets it precisely because it eliminates rest breaks, health insurance, and pension contributions. Beyond jobs: the "ecosystem of the road" that supports Nebraska diners, Ohio motels, and rural repair shops collapses when an AI truck doesn't stop for coffee. The "transition" model of human monitoring creates "automation complacency," stripping skilled professionals down to biological backup systems.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Research from the Georgia Institute of Technology found AI computer vision is significantly less accurate at detecting people with darker skin tones. The training data is predominantly affluent, Western, suburban&mdash;the "baseline" human the AI protects is overwhelmingly fair-skinned. The bias extends geographically: AI is tested in well-maintained Phoenix or Palo Alto streets and performs poorly in lower-income areas with faded signage. "We are subsidizing the safety of the rich by using the rest of the population as crash-test dummies."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Driver Monitoring Systems perform real-time biometric analysis&mdash;tracking pupil dilation, heart rate variability, and micro-expressions. This data goes to insurance aggregators who generate AI "risk scores" without drivers' knowledge. NLP voice assistants store transcripts of private conversations in the cloud. The AI doesn't just navigate roads; it maps habits to create a digital twin sold to the highest bidder. "We are trading the soul of the driving experience for a digital nanny that reports back to its corporate parents."</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">AI-driven design leads to homogenization&mdash;human designers drew from biological analogy (sailfish &rarr; McLaren P1) and cultural context that AI cannot replicate. AI optimizes for drag coefficients but cannot understand "presence." As companies replace junior roles with AI, the talent pipeline constricts: without formative years learning form through clay modeling, the industry suffers a permanent craftsmanship loss.</p>

          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Cites Georgia Tech research showing AI pedestrian detection is significantly less accurate for people with darker skin tones due to training data from affluent, predominantly white suburban environments. Geographic bias compounds this: systems tested in Phoenix or Palo Alto degrade sharply in lower-income urban areas with faded signage and "non-standard" pedestrian behavior. This is not a patchable bug but a structural architectural failure. "High-tech redlining, where safety is a privilege reserved for those who fit the algorithm's 'optimal' profile."</p>
