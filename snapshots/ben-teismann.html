        <p>Ben brings an automotive enthusiast's perspective to the AI debate, examining how algorithmic design and automation threaten the "soul" of cars—both in styling and driving. His central concerns: AI-driven design leads to homogenization and emotional sterility, while "Full Self-Driving" marketing creates dangerous gaps between capability and consumer expectation. He argues for keeping human creativity and human control at the center of automotive culture.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">AI-driven design threatens to standardize beauty. Human designers channeled inspiration from nature, architecture, and music—a McLaren P1 modeled after a sailfish. AI, derivative by nature, gravitates toward "optimal" averages, leading to design homogenization where cars across brands look indistinguishably similar. An algorithm can optimize for drag coefficients but cannot understand "presence"—the way a curve catches light or projects speed while standing still.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Tesla's "Full Self-Driving" engages in "autonowashing"—naming a Level 2 driver-assistance system in a way that encourages Level 5 behavior (complete detachment). Studies show drivers using these systems are significantly more likely to disengage. The system handles the easy 99% but hands back control in the dangerous 1%, creating a "Handover Problem" where bored, distracted humans have less than a second to save their lives.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">As companies replace junior design roles with generative AI, the pipeline for human talent constricts. If the next generation spends formative years "prompting" rather than learning form and shadow through sketching and clay modeling, the industry will suffer from loss of technical literacy. The human-to-human design process captures the "spirit of the times"—something AI, which has no culture or memories, cannot replicate.</p>

          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Argues AI-driven design threatens the emotional and cultural dimensions of automobiles. Human designers drew from biological analogy (sailfish → McLaren P1) and cultural context—leaps AI cannot make. AI optimizes for quantifiable metrics (drag, manufacturing ease) but cannot comprehend "presence" or the visceral feeling of speed. Result: design homogenization across brands, a "craftsmanship crisis" as junior designers are replaced by prompt engineers, and vehicles disconnected from the people who drive them.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 16, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Critiques Tesla's autonomous driving approach on safety, technical, and ethical grounds. The "Autonomy Gap" between marketing and capability creates over-reliance. Tesla's "vision-only" approach (no LiDAR) creates a "brittle" system that fails on edge cases—phantom braking, inability to distinguish white trucks from bright sky. Rolling out "Beta" software to consumer testers uses the public as crash-test dummies. Tesla shields itself from liability while consumers bear the physical and legal risks of system failure.</p>
