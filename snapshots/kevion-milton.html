      <div class="snapshot-summary">
        <p>Kevion brings the AI conversation into sports, specifically examining how AI is transforming basketball officiating. His work raises fundamental questions about whether "perfect" officiating improves or diminishes the game, exploring tensions between algorithmic accuracy and human discretion, objective data and the "moment" of sport. His "Centaur Officiating" proposal—AI handles objective calls, humans handle subjective ones—offers a model for human-AI collaboration applicable beyond sports.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Discretion Problem</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Basketball isn't a game of black-and-white rules—it's a game of "incidental contact." Human referees use discretion: they "let the players play" and only call fouls that actually affect the outcome. If AI blew the whistle on every technical contact, a 48-minute game becomes a three-hour slog of free throws. Discretion is a feature, not a bug.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The "Moment" Problem</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">When a ref decides not to call a foul in the final seconds of a playoff game to "let the players decide it," that's a human choice about the moment. An AI doesn't understand "the moment"—it only understands data points. "Working the refs" has always been a skill. You can't work an algorithm. If we lose the moment, do we lose the reason we watch sports?</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">Centaur Officiating</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Proposes a middle ground: AI handles objective calls (shot clock violations, out of bounds, goaltending) while humans handle subjective calls (shooting fouls, intent, technical fouls). This "Centaur" model preserves human judgment where it matters while gaining accuracy where objectivity is possible.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-title">The Moneyball Effect</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Teams now use AI to scout referees just like they scout players—predicting which refs call more fouls on road teams, which are more likely to call travels. If teams use AI to exploit human refs, is the only solution to replace humans entirely? It feels like a "digital arms race" squeezing out the human element from both sides.</p>

            <span class="snapshot-post-date">January 18, 2026</span>
          </div>
          <p class="snapshot-post-description">Examines how AI tracking technology (cameras tracking player coordinates 25 times per second) is transforming NBA officiating. Explores the tension between perfect accuracy and human discretion—basketball's "incidental contact" requires judgment about what matters. Introduces "Centaur Officiating" as middle ground. Questions whether perfect fairness destroys the drama that makes sports compelling. Connects to network conversation about human intuition via classmate reference. Notes the "Moneyball effect" where teams use AI to exploit referee tendencies, creating pressure to automate further.</p>
